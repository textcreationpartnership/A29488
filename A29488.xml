            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Epiſtle to the READER.</head>
            <p>CHriſtian Reader, concerning <hi>Roger Breirley,</hi> the Author of theſe following Notes of the heads of ſome ſeveral Sermons by him more fully Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his publick Miniſtry, I deſire to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thee of his Life, and Meſſage that he witneſſed. As alſo to give thee an account of the Ground and Riſe of this Word <hi>Grindletoniſm,</hi> by which many men of the World, as adverſe parties, ſtyled his Followers. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life and Converſation therein, it was as became the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and comely in the eyes of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and beautiful in the Streets of that <hi>Citie,</hi> ſo that none could lay any shame thereon. As for his Meſſage, that was given him for to declare to the World, it was mighty and piercing, to the laying open in the very Heart and Conſcience of man, the moſt ſecret and hidden things of dishoneſty, though never ſo cloſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded in the deepeſt miſtery of iniquitie; ſo as many, yea, and many that ſtood fenced in the Field, with the Weapons of their own ſelf-righteouſneſs in the flesh, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, fell wounded to the very ground, and were found to be of Sinners, the chiefeſt. And to this I bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſuch was the Penetrating Power of God in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, that if thouſands were before him under it, in very few hours diſcourſe, every mans ſeveral Condition, whether under Light or Darkneſſe, should have been ſpoken to, layed open, bare and naked; that every one might truely have confeſſed in their ſeveral conditions, that the Word was ſpoken to them in particular: For what was done &amp; acted in every mans heart and ſpirit, was there openly related &amp; revealed, that all might read their ſeven-fold abominations: So that in a word, (for much more here might be related) none either in their <hi>Gentiliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor in their ſelf on taken <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Righteouſneſſe, nor in any formal way either to Law or Goſpel, could ſtand t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And not only ſo, but mighty &amp; powerful was his Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtration, in the evident demonſtration of the Holy Ghoſt, to bear witneſſe, in &amp; to the deſolate, weary, forlorn, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, broken heart of man, ſentenced unto death, of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love, in the faithful Promiſe of the healing Covenant of God, eſtablished in, &amp; with Jeſus Chriſt; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Sin, Death, &amp; Satan, the father of lyes, should not prevail to blaſt &amp; curſe, but it should ariſe the blesſing of his own free love, to ſit above them all in true dominion, by the witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt ſent down in faithfulneſſe from above, to comfort the deſolate, needy, poor, beggerly heart of man; writing the Law of Life in his heart, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon miſtake: went abroad, and great contentions ſtirred up, and jealouſes fixed in mens minds, that ſome great Hereſee, as a monſter, would appear when indeed the living Truth only appeared to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thereof, although thoſe againſt him could not ſee it, but dayly ſought to compare it with ſome new or old Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp; Hereſies. And when they ſought accuſations from this Authors Doctrine, &amp; could find none: being in the hearing of it ſilenced, that they had nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it yet to shewtheir minds, what good will they bare to him in his Meſſage, &amp; to thoſe who did embrace it, becauſe they could not well ſtile them by the name of <hi>Breitliſts,</hi> finding no fault in his Doctrine: they then ſtyled his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers by the name of <hi>Grindletonians,</hi> by a name of a Town in <hi>Cravan,</hi> called <hi>Grindleton,</hi> where this Author did at that time exerciſe his Miniſtry; thinking by his name to render them odious and brand them for ſome kind of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but they could not tell what Sect to parallel them to: Hence roſe the name <hi>Grindletoniſm.</hi> And yet they reſted not with this nicknaming, but raiſed aſperſions againſt this Author: informing the High-Commisſion againſt him; who ſent their commands to bring him up to <hi>York,</hi> where he was kept in priſon for a while, during which time; fifty Articles were exhibited by his Adverſaries againſt him before them: which, when he came to his tryal, not one of them directly proved againſt him. Whereupon, after a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preached by him at the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> he was diſmiſſed, and liberty by L. Bishop <hi>Tobias Matthews,</hi> granted to exerciſe his Miniſtry as formerly: who, after much travel and pains in witnesſing <hi>the glad tidings of Salvation,</hi> ended his Natural Life at <hi>Burnlaie</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> after whoſe Death, theſe few Head-notes of ſome of his Sermons came to my view. Wherein, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> if thou minde well, as thou reads, thou may taſte the fundamental grounds of Truth, and alſo perceive the various deceits of thy deceitful heart, and Satans deep temptations unvailed and diſcovered, to thine and his shame, which thou mayeſt read, as followeth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree ſorts of People troubled the Church, 1. Dogs, which with open mouth fought againſt Chriſt. 2. Evil workers, who profeſſed Chriſt, and yet walked inordinately. 3 The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that cut themſelves off from Chriſt and the Church, by their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions: and fell into Sects, and would needs joyn Circumciſion and fleſhly Righteouſneſſe with Chriſt: and ſo become confident in the fleſh. Againſt which the Apoſtle oppoſeth his own example, who had more to boaſt of than they; and yet it was nothing to him, in compariſon of Chriſt: So he perſwades the Church to hold on forward in the Faith, to the crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying down of all things, till they come to the Reſurrection of the Dead; and in all this Contention, to walk in love: that if ſome did not underſtand the truth of the Myſtery of Chriſt, nor yet were brought thereto, yet to proceed on in love by the ſame Rule; &amp; that God in time would reveal it. Here again he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds his own, and the Faithful for an Example; that they would walk in that way of Faith toward Chriſt, and Love amongſt themſelves: and then he gives them warning of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Some in the Church that were Enemies to Chriſts Croſſe: and ſo deſcribes their courſe and end. 1. He propounds himſelf as a Pattern. 2. He warnes them of falſe Teachers or Brethren: In whom conſider, 1. His affection, <hi>Of whom I have told
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97089:6"/> you often, and now tell you weeping.</hi> 2. Their curſe in theſe particulars; 1. They are Enemies to Chriſt. 2. Their God is their belly. 3. Their Glory is their ſhame. 4. They mind earthly things. 5. Their End is Damnation. This was no vain boaſting, for elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, be acknowledgeth himſelf the leaſt of all Saints, but only oppoſeth himſelf and the faithful againſt falſe Brethren, who only for Glory lived in Envy, ſought earthly gain by the Goſpel, lived inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; and leſt that weaklings by them ſhould be drawn to fleshly liberty. But look on them which walk after our example, for we have no confidence in the flesh: We count not our ſelves perfect, we ſeek not glory, nor profit, but only the maintenance of the Truth of the Goſpel; <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in Chriſt only, and Love to all men. So that this being their example: Note that,</p>
            <p>Faith in Chriſt, and ſimple Love to Man is the very Summe of the Goſpel, and the Life of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the heart of Man, Gal. 5. <hi>Faith works by love.</hi> 1. Tim. 1. <hi>The end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart, a good Conſcience, and faith unfeigned,</hi> all elſe ver. 7. <hi>is droſs and dung.</hi> This is the ſumme of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles: This <hi>Paul</hi> to Tim calls the <hi>ſpirit of faith, love and a ſound mind.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God, for to the Col. <hi>the Faith and love to all Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For theſe deſtroy Self Righteouſneſs, and Self Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and Self Love; which are the poyſon of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>viz.</hi> Self Witt, and Self Will; theſe <hi>Adam</hi> got, and therein oppoſed God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For by Faith he is made a Lord over all things, that will ſuffer nothing to ſtart up in the Church, and in his Heart, but Chriſt: and by Love he is ſervant to all, and plyable; and ſervant to every one. By the one he is freed with God, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Faith, he that had thought to live in, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97089:6"/> by himſelf, through the Law, comes to dye in himſelf; and to live in, and by another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay, all Religion without theſe is nothing, but meer opinion and conceit, whereby the heart is puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and ſo not fit for mercy, and alſo tyed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his own good: Minde the Religion of Chriſt: was it any thing, but a denying of himſelf, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Father, and giving himſelf to the Church in love: yea, to his very Enemies? Which Faith and Love is nothing elſe, but a partaker ſo of himſelf, and his own weakneſſe, Sin and Death thereby: that he can believe and truſt nothing in himſelf or the world, but only the Word of God, and in that weakneſs waits on Chriſt and meere Mercy, and cut of that diſlike of himſelf, and love to that he ſees in Chriſt, loves all, judgeth none but himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How far are we then from Chriſts Religion, when all our Religion is, 1. Either in Fire of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and diſputations about this and that Opinion, maintaining of our ſingular conceits, wherein we ſeem to excel others in knowledge, whereby true love is drowned quite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or in ſome ſingular conceit of quality and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which we conceive in our ſelves, and thereby grow proud, and deſpiſe Chriſt, and trample mercy under our feet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or in high roveing conceits of the eternal Deity, Majeſty and Power, and Secret Will, and Purpoſe of God, without Chriſt; whereby the heart is hardened.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or in the Notion of the Goſpel and Chriſt; and faith without the power thereof, gloriouſly vaunting of deep Myſteries: But in all theſe, the thing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>viz.</hi> an humble low, believing and loving heart like unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus in all theſe, man leaves his own heart, and followes his heady opinion; he forſakes Chriſt, and pleaſeth himſelf with his own qualities:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97089:7"/> turnes from the word, and followes vain ſpeculations, denyes the Faith, and lives by the flesh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Know then, that whatever would draw thee from Chriſt and his Truth, is not the Doctrine of God; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſets up man, and makes him any thing but a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is not the doctrine of Chriſt, but of the Devil and Antichriſt; for it deſtroyes faith.</p>
            <p>Pray we then that the Doctrine of the Goſpel, even of Faith and Love may be continued pure in the Church: For Maus Wit and Reaſon will gather a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Errors out of Gods Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> when it will not be content to become a fool, but will needs comprehend a ſpiritual Truth, and determine thereof according to its own Principles and Judgement. Then it brings a world of abſurdities; for all errors have riſen out of the Wit of fleshly minded men, for the Spirit leads unto all Truth.</p>
            <p>And I fear, there will ariſe men of perverſe minds, to pervert the truth of the Goſpel: ſome to their carnal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſome to the eſtablishing of a righteouſneſſe and power in man, without Chriſt: bear we the Infirmities of men: But take heed of falſe Doctrine in the Church, for this is the worſt of all.</p>
            <p>And I pray God, that many alive do not ſee that the Truth of the Goſpel be turned into the Myſterie of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and a greater Myſterie of ſpiritual wickedneſſe than yet we have ſeen: <hi>Sed magna Veritas &amp; praevalet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Great is the Truth and prevaileth</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the kindly effect of the Goſpel is, to eſtablish theſe two in the heart of man, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring all things down in man by the Croſſe of Chriſt, and ſo lay him low under thee feet of all: For the Goſpel is a low thing, Faith is a low thing, though mighty in Chriſt: and Love is a low thing; Therefore all high flowen Chimical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is the Doctrine of Satan, and not of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if man be brought under the power hereof, then will Chriſt be precious to him, and his Word will be the Life and Treaſure of his Soul, becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97089:7"/> man hath nothing to ſtay him in his deep humility but only he: And then will man love a man, becauſe he is a man: and not becauſe he is of my opinion, or good to me, or of my way or linage: but loves as Chriſt did, yea, h s very Enemies, <hi>As you have us for an example,</hi> viz. <hi>Us in whom you ſee the Truth of the Goſpel to rule, and to walk according to the ſame, who ſeek Chriſts Kingdom, not ours,</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>He walks ſafely, who truly feeling his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and believes man for the Truths ſake, and not the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Follow me as I follow Chriſt: <hi>But many were drawn away by the Error of the wicked.</hi> For man having a good conceit of another, is apt to believe what he ſaith: for he believes that God is with him, and ſo falls into odd opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Better we should never preach, than that the Goſpel ſhould be believed for our ſakes. Can we that are nothing bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Men that profeſſe Chriſt, but deny him in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: their minds is not prepared by faith and patience to bear the Croſſe; partly in doctrine they denyed it not underſtanding that myſtery, partly and eſpecially in life; for they lived in ſenſuallity and fleshly pleaſures and yet profeſſed the Goſpel. So that,</p>
            <p>Manie in the Church profeſſe Chriſt, and the Truth of the Goſpel, which deny, and are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, and deny the power of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>This is to denie him before men. To the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> the Doctrine of the Croſſe was foolishneſſe.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97089:8"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> when he was called before the Emperor, they all denied him.

            <p>In Chriſt you ſee it was, Firſt, <hi>He bare the iniquity of us all,</hi> ſo to us, when man bears iniquity in daily reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. <hi>He bare the Fathers wrath,</hi> ſo we judgement and wrath in our ſelves. 3.

To pacifie wrath by ſelf holineſſe in our own conceit only. 3. And for the World to keep it alive in our hearts, and cheriſh it under Chriſts wings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And how many of us are ſuch, we all believe and like well of the Goſpel, and to hear of ſitting at Chriſts right hand, but to drink of his Cup, none hath a minde.

The Child can bear any thing better, we all like Goſpel, but we will looſe nothing for it, which argues, we have little confidence in the truth thereof, and little joy therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But we can talk of the Croſſe and ſufferings, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97089:9"/> we talk of it with light and merry hearts, we make but a play-game of it, for we ſeek not the bitterneſſe of Chriſts agony, nor the ſmart of the Croſſe, and ſo we dally with all truth, we boaſt, with <hi>Peter,</hi> that we will die with him, <hi>but before the Cock crow, we deny him thrice.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="4">4. And happy is he that is guided by Chriſt in this way, and that his eyes are kept waking all night, and feels the terrors of the Almighty, for he is ſafe from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie; It is not the dreaming of a power and free-will in man, by uſe whereof, ſecuritie is prevented: but it is the Croſſe of Chriſt on man, that keeps him waking; for <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt fell a ſleep, notwithſtanding, Chriſts warning given to them ſo often; only becauſe they dreamed of ſuch a power as <hi>Peter</hi> boaſted, but not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Croſſe that lyed on Chriſt. Nay, all errors have ſprung in the Church for want of this, for while men were kept within themſelves, and their own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, their pride was kept under: but when they had loſt themſelves, and begun to be ſtrong men of knowledge in conceit, then they began to be maſters, and run into a thouſand opinions from truth, and theſe are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſts Croſſe. Firſt, Thoſe that live in eaſe and pleaſure under profeſſion and knowledge of the Goſpel, and ſeed on the World as their dainty dish. Secondly, Thoſe which bear out ſin through hardneſſe of heart; he bare the ſin of all, but theſe bear it not as a burden, but as a pleaſure and delyte: Thirdly, Which put of wrath and judgement, through ſelf righteouſneſſe and qualities, and ſo with Chriſt bear not the indignation of the Lord: Fourthlie, Which are lifted up in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, but walk not in that denying, humble, and believing way of Chriſt: And it is a fearfull thing to ſtumble at this ſtone, and to frame a Chriſt to our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97089:9"/> ſelves: but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will cruſh all thoſe to pieces, and bring down their pride <hi>(whoſe god is their belly.)</hi> Thoſe who were profeſſors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel, and yet under pretence thereof ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their own luſts and appetites they went talking of Religion, and thereby got good cheare: labour not in their calling but made advantage of the Goſpel, to the ſatisfying of their luſts: Theſe he gives warning of as e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emies So that,</p>
            <p>It is a fearful thing, and dangerous in the Church, and to man: when man under knowledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, ſeeks chiefly the ſerving of his own luſts, and pleaſures of his appetite and not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, that they ſerved their own bellies and not Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>That they turned the grace of God into wantoneſſe,</hi> and yet frequented their feaſts of love: And others <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, that under pretence of <hi>long pray rs, ſpoyled widdows houſes, and led captive ſimple Women;</hi> Theſe <hi>Paul</hi> commanded, <hi>that ſeing they would not work, they should not eat:</hi> They profeſſe that they know God, but in deed deny him, that is, They are ſilled with knowledge, that Chriſt is the way of Life in Juſtification, but they follow the world in their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titte and deny him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For thus, Religion is made but only a cloak to a rotten and fleshly heart, that under it, they may better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own deſires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that have the knowledge of the Goſpel without the power thereof, that have learned to know Chriſt, but not as the truth is in Jeſus, they want the power of his death, which is indeed all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe never came in by the right door, the denying of themſelves, forſaking all, and taking up the Croſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And thus doth moſt of us that profeſſe Chriſt to be our Lord and King, our life and hope, our joy, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and that beſides him, there is none under heaven, and yet none denyes him more. We, would enjoy Chriſt with full bellies, and purſes, and ſo enjoy Chriſt in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97089:10"/> Flesh but Luſt: rules over the Spirit. Thus we ſtrive to have Heaven and Earth both, which cannot be: what care and labour to pleaſe our bellies? Is not all a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> care for his mouth, and yet his deſire is not ſatisfied? this we make ſure of to look too; Is not moſt of thy life time ſpent in labour about that curious belly of thine, ſummer and winter, night and day, all is but for back and belly, and yet nature is ſatisfied with a litle? And theſe are ſtill h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d-hearted men, had rather the poor perish in the Streets, than they want to ſatisfie their appetites: For if a man would but ſpare the tenth penny that he ſpends idelie, only to pleaſe his luſt, would it not relieve a Town? Nay, if that vain waſte were ſpared, which man ſpends on his luſts, only to feed a ſort of fat idle hoſteſſes, it would keep the poor of a Paroch. And then if our gairesh women would but ſpare one Lace and Garde of five, it would cloth them from cold. Well, Chriſt will be no pattern for theſe things. But above all ashame it is for believers to ſtoup to this looſe god, to live daintily and fair delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. How many Martyrs have lyne in priſon with bread and water, and yet better hearts? are we enemies to the flesh, and yet pampers it? Is flesh thus crucified with Chriſt and yet ſo great a god unto us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then if the Croſſe go not along with the Goſpel, it proſpers not, but flesh is ſtrong and preſſeth to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and man will not, cannot lay violent hands upon it, but even this muſt be given of God, that he keep man down, and his luſts and deſires under, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo to ſee and feel himſelf, as, 1. That he shall think himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any food, or to live. 2. That his minde be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with want of another thing, even Chriſt, that his minde is thereby drawn off all theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But he that walks orderly with Chriſt under the Croſſe, is pleaſed with any thing: Brown bread and the Goſpel is good fare, not vowing wilfull poverty, but rejoycing in Chriſt; and all his gifts, yet well contented in the want of them: <hi>whoſe glory is in their shame,</hi> of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll end in shame, <hi>viz</hi> They ſeek glory by their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97089:10"/> and Profeſſion of the Goſpel, but this courſe will bring more shame, then if they had never profeſſed it. They ſeek glory but it is but a poor portion. So that,</p>
            <p>Many in the Church profeſſe the Goſpel, that they may gain glory to themſelves thereby in the eyes of man, rather than out of ſimple love, and ſimpathize of heart with the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>You ſeek honour one of another; The Diſciples ſought who to be greateſt. Phariſees took the uppermoſt rooms made their Phylactaries broad, &amp; all to be ſeen of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For reſpect is ſtill the aim of all knowledge, and therefore, man labours for knowledge, that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo: this itching humour ſetting him a work, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his own miſery and want.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This doth ſtill follow the Goſpel, others that profeſſe not, look for no glory this way, and yet this shall end in shame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is not this apparent, when men ſpeak and talk of Religion, and utter great bumbaiſted tearmes, and flie and ſoare above, when God ſpeaks not in them all to be ſeen and heard: nay, when we preach to pleaſe men, we are not the ſervants of Chriſt; but when out of love to Chriſt, and ſenſe of the miſerie of man, and our own, we pitie man, and make known the will of the Father to them, then we ſerve Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have not all an aiming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſire of this, man loath to appear Ignorant, but cloaths himſelf with knowledge: well, Chriſt ſees thy double heart, and his ſervants feel not the warming power of his Spirit in thee, therefore it shall end in shame, Chriſt loved the <hi>Publican</hi> better than thoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſure a believing, loving heart walks in shame, which ſhall be turned to his Glory, for he that ſeeks Glory ſhall never have it, and be that ſeeks it not shall have it, he that truely underſtands himſelf never looks for good opinion of any, for look what good opinion a man hath of himſelf, he looks that all the World should have the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke of him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And this shall end in shame: for God will dishonor

            <p>This good will of God is not to be comprehended by man, for it reſts in the Word of God, &amp; there to be made known in time, and only to be believed. For all the works of God, are never known till they be

Therefore, the Apoſtles commanded the evil Spirit by the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> And as he that rules in his own Name is a Traitor, and doth no good; So he that thinks to live and rule by his own power, ſhal not prevail: This conceit only ariſeth out of blind pride, that when God hath ſhown his power in him he takes it to himſelf: and ſtores it up in conceit: and this out of the ſtrength of Luſt that will needs have another thing than he gives: or out of a proud opinion, that he would believe another truth than his. So that luſt and opinion are the two great enemies of Faith: But if thou haſte ſome abilities out of Chriſt in thy ſelf, What? 1. needs thou Faith? to believe in him; or to pray him? 2.

            <p>No power or poſſibility in man by the ſtrength of natural wit, to know the good will &amp; pleaſure of God, or the Miſtery of Chriſt; ſo as man ſhall find life theteby or certainty therein; but as the Father makes himſelf known in Chriſt, by his Word &amp; power of his Spirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faith of man believing his truth, 1.

None knowes him, whoſe miſerable heart is not delivered from Death by him: who believes his truth above all, then this truth makes him free.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſee then, that all Knowledge comes by Faitht as, ſuppoſe a man a Stranger, promiſe to ranſome me (a captive) I believe he will: but I know not that he

            <p n="1">1. This Doctrine is fooliſhneſſe to the World, which know none other good but the World: Its hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a wordly heart, that there is ſo little good, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. So that Chriſts yoke and Croſſe never hurts the Church, as in the time of the Martyrs, it purified Faith. It is a practical divinity; it manifeſts mans weakneſſe, Gods power, and truth, which before man thinks not of, but now he believes and feels.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why then ſhould we fear affliction? why do we grieve and mourn, and cark, and care?

            <p>IN the former verſes hath been laid down the birth of Chriſt, and the manner thereof: According to the propheſies gone of him before. Here is laid down the manifeſtation hereof to the world. It was the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97089:21"/> greateſt meſſage that ever was brought into the World, and the moſt unliklie to be believed by the World: That a poor infant, born of poor Parents: ſo diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, that they could not be admitted to come into the Inne, but born in a ſtable, and laid in a manger: wrapped in a few cloaths: And this now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the poor shepherds in the fields: and by them reported to the men of <hi>Bethlem:</hi> When the Church being then in trouble and bondage: looked for ſome great and glorious <hi>Mesſiah</hi> to come, with great pompe, and power, to work deliverance for them: and this muſt be the man, raiſed up by the power of God, to be the light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the glorie of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We celebrate this Feaſt, in remembrance of this great Savior, and worker of deliverance: Like that of <hi>Purim</hi> in <hi>Eſther:</hi> But we conſecrate it to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> not to Chriſt, in Rioting, and Drunkenneſſe, in Chambring &amp; Wantonneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not in povertie of Spirit, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility with Chriſt: but in pride, and fullneſſe of the World. Our joy is not in communion with Chriſt in his birth, and death: but in liberty to the Flesh, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of all. O, if Chriſt should come, as he will come, and find us thus: One ſwilling and drinking: another carding, and dicing: another whoring: And all under pretence of love to him: Would he take it well? O no!</p>
            <p>Chriſt was born in a time, and manner, little looked for by the World, and yet in a time of great need: For the Church was now grown to a low ebb: From <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For now they had no more Propheſies, but a very vaiting on the word of Promiſes: Yea, &amp; now according to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Propheſie, the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and they Tributaries to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And now was the time, though not known to the World, not expected, yet, now the fullneſſe of time being come, Chriſt is ſent: Thus God dealeth in the Kingdom of Chriſt. So that,</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97089:22"/>
            <p>God hath a time reſerved in his own purpoſe, for deliverance and redemption of man, which he ſends not, when, and how he laſtingly expects; but only to be waited one by lowly Faith, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e word of Truth, which ſhall come, when man in Flesh and ſenſe ſees leaſt reaſon, and leaſt expects it.</p>
            <p>When thou brought again the captivity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Sion:</hi> we were as them that dream, Hab. 2. <hi>The viſion is for an appointed time,</hi> and the prodigal little looked for intertainment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For ſo God deals in all, that he may be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: For to the wicked, he comes in judgment, when they are eating and drinking, and cry, peace, peace: and to believers in mercy, when they cry woe, and miſery, bondage, and death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath given a ſure Word of the Prophets to be attended on: For the time he hath in his own power, and that time is worth waiting on, in Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not mans device and work that can haften his time: Not going up to Heaven, nor down to Hell, but abiding in the word of truth, being near, even in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Thus, we would all fain haſten the time: As in the Church, there was great expectation; yea, <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired to ſee this day: So we all would know where, when, and how: But the Kingdom of Chriſt comes not with obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we be in miſerie; we think too long, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure: Thy deſire God ſees; but thy Impatience he likes not: He will anſwer thy deſires and longing: but he will make thee, Firſt, willing to bear his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yea, and we no ſooner begin to feel the ſmart of our guilt a little, but we think Chriſt ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie come; nay, but we muſt pay tribute, and be taxed, and feel Repentance and the bitterneſſe thereof: and wait in Faith, and then he shal be born unto us: But man is loath to ſit in darkneſſe and death: &amp; yet the Kingdom of God never comes, but to repenting hearts: <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97089:22"/>2. As alſo, When we think, becauſe of this and that qualitie or diligence, or repentance, or humilitie, he should come: Nay, he muſt not be bound by man, nor to man, by nothing but his own Word; and he will thus croſſe mans fleſhly hopes, when thou thinks thy fell the neareſt, thou art the fartheſt off; and when thou findeſt thy ſelf the fartheſt off, then thou art the neareſt.</p>
            <p>And it is a thing to be noted, That Chriſt came into the World, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> went everie one to his own Citie to be taxed: even when they went to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their bondage and captivitie under the <hi>Romans,</hi> then was Chriſt born: which is alſo to be obſerved ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, <hi>viz.</hi> When everie man in his own heart lives in bondage, fear and captivated by Satan, and hath no power to redeem himſelf, but confeſſeth his thraldom and lyes under it: then is Chriſt born unto the heart, for he came to deliver the Captives.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As alſo that the Church was now at a great want, for the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was left in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Pſal. 74. <hi>None the guide or teach them:</hi> nothing left but the word of Promiſe, which ſeemed to be void, <hi>and God to have forſaken them:</hi> And now Chriſt comes, and is born, ſo it is with us. <hi>And there were Shepherds in the Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Chriſts birth is manifeſted. Firſt obſcurelie, to poor Shepherds, and theſe muſt carry the tydings of great Joy: wherein, note that vvonderful humility and lovv eſtate vvherein Chriſt appeared to the World, though he vvas the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, Wherein note Chriſts vvay, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the way of Chriſt; from the firſt to the laſt in accomplishing Mans Redemption, is in povertie, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and deep humilitie of Heart: far ſeparated from the World, and the riches and glory thereof, Phil. 2. <hi>He was equal with God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet took on him the form, of a ſervant.</hi> Iſa. 5.3. <hi>He hath neither form nor beauty; nothing ſeen, why we should deſire him: he was deſpiſed and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of men, a man of ſorrows, and had experience of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; we hid our faces from him, and eſteemed him not:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97089:23"/> the rich of the world cared not for him: The gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not his own glory, but the good of all; he was ſtill among the poor, and halt, and blind, and beggars; and had not whereon to lay his head: his meſſage was carried by fishers and ignorant men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This was the Wiſdom of the Father, that the eminence of the Parties, nor the wiſdom of man ſhould not cauſe his Goſpel to be believed, but the Evidence of the Truth: according to the ancient Propheſies, <hi>He will not have the Goſpel to be credited becauſe of Man, but Man for the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This he doth, to keep man lowe; that he may ſee nothing to lift him up in the World, but the word of Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to ſhew the difference betwixt his Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the World, who only ſeeks high things &amp; ſtands in glorie and outward reſpects; but his in poverty and miſerie. Though in that low eſtate God manifeſted ſuch a glorie and power, as the World was not capable of: For <hi>He was</hi> a greater Conquerour than <hi>Ceſar, Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Alexander;</hi> for they ſubdued a few Kingdoms, and yet ſlaves to their own vain glory and luſts: but he overcame the whole World, and Hell too, that he cared nor a rash for it, and yet but lodged in a manger. And this is the way that the mindly low, that it riſe not after the World: but ſo raiſed by Faith, that it tramples it under foot: For as the <hi>Heathen</hi> man could ſay, He is valiant, not only who kills Lyons &amp; Bears, and wilde beaſts, but he who overcomes his own pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſo in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the daily life of man in himſelf is, repentance, or ſecuritie and pride: that he ſo live in himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that Sin and the World is a burden to him: Yea, that have ſtill that opinion of himſelf that the World had of Chriſt: yea; that as he was counted the greateſt ſinner of the World by the World, that he was ignorant and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, ſo that man ſee and feel the ſins of all men in himſelf, that he beheld no good in anything, but in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97089:23"/> Chriſt; nor no evil in any thing, but in himſelf. This keeps him in the manger, and among poor Shepherds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How far then are we from Chriſts birth or way, who only ſeek to be great in the World, which all ſtrive at: it is not a manger or a ſtable that will fit them: but like Lords of the Earth ſeek preheminence. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Chriſt becomes a ſtone to them, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pleaſe but riches and greatneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others who imagine themſelves to be born of God, becauſe of this and that good quality; and ſtill ſtrain at high things, thereby to draw near to God. But this way they are farther of: for all Gods people are born in humility, and live lowly and humblie even in the ſtable: that is well pleaſed with any thing, and ſo advanced by Gods free gift, for which they praiſe him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What though we be baſe, and fools in the eyes of the World and that we want the glory thereof; it was ſo with Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, it is our freedom if we want it: or having it, care not for it: Now, as it was the Fathers will that Chriſt ſhould be born in a Stable, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Shepherds; ſo it is his will that thou art poor and deſpiſed, but he had a care of his Son, he will alſo bring thee through it, though with leſſe pomp, yet with as much eaſe, and at death no difference; but only that thou with Chriſt will willingly part with it; and he, with much grief and ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We hear many ſay, They would have ſuccoured Chriſt better, but thou hateſt him in his members: What good doeſt thou to them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Angel of the Lord came upon them.</hi> He came to reveal this great myſtery, &amp; to ſhew the truth of all the promiſes now accomplished, none able to do it but an Angel from Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> an heavenly meſſenger: ſo that</p>
            <p>No underſtanding of the Myſtery of Chriſt, or ſeeing the truth of the Promiſe accompliſhed, but as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and freely given from above.</p>
            <p>Man in nature perceives not the things of God, 1 Joh. 4. <hi>There is an anointing from above that teacheth all things, and none can ſay that Jeſus is the Chriſt, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97089:24"/> by the Holy Ghoſt, though we think that Jeſus is the Chriſt and Saviour:</hi> Yet we think but after the flesh: but his wonderful Love, Truth, Power, bitterneſſe of Sufferings, Victory over Hell and Death: not known by comprehending, but revealed to poor and miſerable minds from above:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the Father hath hid all wiſdom in Chriſt from the wiſe of the World: and it is to be found in him, not in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt prayes to the Father to reveal this to them, That they may know, that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>And this was promiſed of Chriſt, that after his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th he would ſend a Comforter, that should lead them into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What a world of conceits have we of Chriſt, and yet know him not: becauſe we think we know.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some know the Hiſtorie of Chriſt, and moved with natural paſſions by the conſideration of his paſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some ſtrive to know the Myſterie of Chriſt after the flesh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee that all knowledge comes by faith, and is revealed from heaven: as a man that promiſeth to free me, being a captive: I believe him, but I know not that he will, till he reveal his will to me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where then is the power of man in the uſe of this general gift of knowledge to come to know Chriſt? <hi>None knows the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, but the Son</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Wouldeſt thou know the wonderful Myſterie of Chriſt? Sit in thy own ignorance, mourning in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and wait in the word of Truth, till the light shine, and thou shalt underſtand, though not the mind of God, yet the mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they were ſore afraid.</hi> The glory aſtonished them, the meſſage brought fear to humble them, ſo in all: ſo that,</p>
            <p>The proper and kindly operation of the whole Word and Meſſage of the Goſpel, in the mouth of Chriſt, is to bring man down: and the foundation of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97089:24"/> is laid in fear, to lay man low; that he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To deny our ſelves, to become fools, and loſt; as <hi>Paul, I was alive, but when the Law came, I was dead; all our Righteouſneſſe as filthy rags; the weapons of our warfare are mighty to bring down:</hi> all the whole Scripture to man, as he is man, ſpeaks negatively and baſely, onlie exalts Jeſus Chriſt as the Law-giver, in thunder to ſhake the heart of man; the Goſpel and the Promiſe made without any reſpect of any righteouſneſſe in man; and the povver whereby this becomes effectual is from another, and not from our ſelves. Thus was <hi>Paul</hi> brought to his knees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For it ever brings man to fear and weakneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it bring faith, and preſerves fear, that he may ſtill reſt on Chriſt; for when any Land hath been conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Firſt, they weaken them, and bring them into fear, and then they yield; ſo doth Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Word opening to man the Book of his own heart, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. diſcovers ſuch a miſerie &amp; guilt and weakneſſe, that he cryes, <hi>What should I do?</hi> And as often as it opens mans mind, it diſcovers ſuch a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon: ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t hereby he is driven from himſelf, and all boaſting is taken away. But man ſtores himſelf with better qualities and better conceits, and ſtarts from himſelf; but if <hi>Adams</hi> eyes be opened, he ſhall ſee nothing but nakedneſſe, and the Groſſe shall weare out all theſe fig leaves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Everie man is grown proud and wiſe and high in knowledge againſt Chriſt, and hath gotten either the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rld, or knovvledge, or righteouſneſſe, or ſomething that bears him up: therefore it muſt be a mighty word that muſt make all theſe nothing to man, &amp; perſwade him that the world hath no good in it, nor no wiſdom: nor in all creatures no life, but in another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But vve all pervert this vvord to our deſtruction, when we vvill needs comprehend it, but are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by it; vve judge it, and are not judged by it: and ſo vve keep off fear: for vve are made vviſe and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97089:25"/> righteous, according to the form thereof; and becomes men of high thoughts, but not men of low minds, and thereby rejects the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. The word known after the flesh, and not believed, lifts up and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens more than any thing; but the Word believed, brings down, and layes low in weakneſſe, and preſerves fear, &amp; makes man nothing, that Chriſt may be exalted, but we believe not the thouſand part of that we know.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So that the Word of Truth is a mighty Word, it layes all low before it: none is able to ſtand before it but Chriſt, not the holieſt <hi>Phariſee:</hi> for this ſhall judge the World, and caſt out all the fictions of man, and all the pride and glory of the World: and shall be a terrible Word to all that believe not; when everie tittle thereof shal be verified on man.</p>
            <p>O that! we were all ſtricken with fear, and ſenſible of our weakneſſe: for as we fear, ſo we believe. But man hath gotten ſo many coverings, that he runs from one to another to hide himſelf from his own heart: Some by the Worlds fulneſſe, but that shall vanish. Some by knowledge and righteouſneſs after the Law? and bardened therein; but theſe shall not ſtand: no nothing shall remain indeed, but Chriſt and the Goſpel: <hi>Be not afraid,</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Chriſt and the Goſpel only belongs to fearful, and weak men, that firſt ſee death and danger, and no help in themſelves to eſcape; and ſigh, and cry, and pray, and ſee no deliverance: Then in time, the Angel from God bringing the meſſage of the Goſpel frees them, that the gates of hell shal not prevail.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible that the heart of man should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved from fear, but by Chriſt only.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the World is not able to free a worldly heart from fear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All knowledge leaves the heart fearfull though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for a time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All holineſſe, and qualities, and ſacrifice, not able to purge the conſcience: but only the blood of Chriſt, and man fixed thereon: And this only ſhall turn fear unto Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97089:25"/>1. So that the Goſpel, I fear, belongs but to few of us, for fear is baniſhed, weakneſſe is grown ſtrong, and gotten up again: Sorrow is turned into lightneſſe; ſighing and praying into vaunting and boaſting, ſo that we need not ſay, we be afraid. But O man! look into that dead and rotten heart of thine: obſerve that croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, faithleſſe, and worldly path: and be aſtonished, for the kingdom of Chriſt was come near thee. But ſeing thou deſpiſeſt it, lo we turn to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> for fearleſs and careleſs eſtate is fallen upon all, and under the cover of Religion, without Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy,</hi> viz. The accomplishment of the Promiſe in the birth of Chriſt; therefore, ſeek no ſhifts to eſcape, turn hither, and behold great joy, and freedom againſt all ſorrows. So that,</p>
            <p>The only ground of all joy, &amp; freedom, to a troubled heart, is only Chriſt made known unto man, in the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced only in the Croſſe of Chriſt, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things elſe but dung, and had no confidence in the Flesh, by our rejoycing that I have in Chriſt Jeſus; I die daily, all other things died unto him, and being juſtified by Chriſt, we rejoyce in tribulation: How was the mourning of <hi>Mary</hi> turned into peace and joy by Chriſt, Iſa <hi>They rejoyced as men in harveſt, and that divides the ſpoil, and they that ſow in tears, shall reap in joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For all joy but this, is nothing but miſtakings, &amp; like a man that laughs in Sleep, for want of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in himſelf, and feeding himſelf with ſhadows and tidings that Satan brings to him.</p>

               </gap>joy, is but rejoicing in the Flesh. He only comforts the Spirit, when Flesh mourns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All other joyes ends in ſorrow, but this ſorrow in joy. What is all the joy the World can give to man, even as the cracking of Thorns under a pot: Thou art rich and full of wealth, yet a carefull heart in the midſt thereof. Thou joyes to day, and mourns to

            <p n="1">1. The World brings tidings or wealth, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But Chriſt, from the love of the Father, that is worth all: Now this never ſprings, but from mourning in our ſelves: like that of <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion to Chriſt: So then the difference of theſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, One rejoyceth to gain the World; another to be freed from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. One to have his ovvn will; and another to loſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. One to have all things, and ſuffer nothing: another to ſuffer all things, and to have nothing but Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee, that all joy that we conceive, that ariſeth out of Religion, and not hence: is but a fondation layed in man: which will die with him.</p>
            <p>But as the Child is merry in his Fathers love, though he knovv nothing vvhat shall be done to it: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is heir, and muſt be advanced to a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo it is vvith us, not from any quality in our ſelves, but in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For unto you is born:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Chriſt truely born unto man, is the only fountain of Life unto man in all diſtreſſes. <hi>In the Citie of David,</hi> Mic. 4. So that nothing shall diſannul the truth of the Word of God, nor shake the heart that is ſtayed thereon</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Savior,</hi> You and the World ſeemes to be loſt &amp; condemned: but behold, here is a Saviour at hand, even a Saviour ſent to you. So that,</p>
            <p>The only ſtay and reſt unto the reſtleſſe heart of man, is aſſurance of a Saviour, &amp; confidence of heart in him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Simeon, Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zach. That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, &amp;c.</hi> And haſt raiſed up for us a mighty Salvation. And he shall ſave the people from their ſins: Such a Saviour

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For man is a loſt and condemned creature, the word of truth hath judged him, his own heart hath given ſentence againſt him: For this hath the Spirit of man ſought, ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall: ſome in the World, ſome in themſelves, but never found, but by Chriſt. The very Heathens ſought it, and we make many Saviours, but all faile, ſave this. It is not with us, as it was with the Diſciples: we have found the Lord Chriſt: We go a ſeeking, and enquiring, but we have not found the Lord.</p>
            <p>He ſaves us out of the hand of our enemies, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the guilt of our Souls and temptation of Satan.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the corruption of our Nature, and bondage of corruption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From affliction, and ſorrow, and croſſes and want.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From death, and hell, and judgement at the laſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See thoſe miſerable Saviours that we frame, as the world or wiſdom, or ſelf-righteouſneſſe: theſe vve get, but yet we are in the hand of our enemies: our heart's full of fear, and death's a terror to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Saviour is born and given to none, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned men; like a murtherer, that can find no way to eſcape, goes to the King, and confeſſeth, and cryes for mercie; the King pardons for his own glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But know that our Salvation ſtands in another, not in our ſelves; though we ſtore our ſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide great and ſtrong arguments againſt that day, yet all will fail; and only bearing indignation of the Lord, &amp; committing to free mercy, muſt be our ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pardoning of Sin. 2. In preſerving the heart in Faith by the Word, to live and dye with Chriſt, and go through all in Patience; not as moſt, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the likelieſt to procure a Saviour, is to come with their own righteouſneſs and holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that we come ſinners and condemned, not bringing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,

            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt the Lord, viz</hi> The anointed Lord, who was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had the holie Oyle reſerved in the Temple, ſanctified by <hi>Moſes:</hi> wherewith their Kings and Prieſts were anointed. Now the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> ſay, that this Oyle ceaſed in the ſecond Temple, till Chriſt came: who was to be anointed with the holie Ghoſt. So that,</p>
            <p>God the Father, according to his eternal purpoſe, hath anointed Chriſt to be Lord and King of his Church, to rule in the heart of man, that God and his power may he magnified, and man made happie in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath given all judgement to the Son: All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth, all things are given in me to my Father: he hath hid all treaſures in him, and hath laid help on one that's mighty,</hi> as Pſal. 4.8.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſted in his Word, never man ſpake like this man, and his miracles, hath it been ſaid, that a man opened the eyes of one that was born blind: This the Father did, by an eternal purpoſe, for the ſalvation of man, that ſeing man could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Gods purpoſe; he ſent one in our room, to whom he hath given power, becauſe that we could not aſcend to Heaven, we might have a God on Earth.

In the end, he leaves them with a ſharp nip: <hi>But wiſdom is juſtified of her Children, viz.</hi> the Children of the Truth, will juſtifie the Truth, though againſt themſelves, and though all the world beſides ſhould reject it: ſo that,</p>
            <p>The Children of the Truth do in their hearts juſtifie and bear witneſſe, and clear the Word of Truth, though it be to the condemning of themſelves 1. Cor. 14. <hi>They fall down and ſay, of a truth Chriſt is in this man:</hi> ſo though the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. condemned and killed <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he juſtified it to be good holy, juſt and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but <hi>I am carnal:</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>That thou mayeſt be juſtified and clear,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="1">1. For it leaves that impreſſion in the heart, which all the lyes and shapes of Satan cannot wipe out; though they may cover and hide: Yet this is more powerful in him than all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For this diſcovers the Intents of the heart, and ſtrikes the heart down, &amp; whatever upheld it: againſt which, man is not able to ſtand; but as the guilty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon juſtifies the ſentence of the Judge, ſo he juſtifies the righteous ſentence of the Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But we ſee, that thouſands which profeſſe Chriſt, yet juſtifieth not his Word: Nay, we judge the Word, and are not judged by it: We rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Word, and are not comprehended and ruled by it.

            <p>Nay, everie man labour to juſtifie himſelf rather than God, and his Truth; and everie thing, on which man dependeth; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The worldling labours to juſtifie the world, and the wayes thereof in his thoughts.</p>

               <hi>The Phariſee deſired him to eat with him.</hi> He ever was to ſpy ſome advantage for further juſtifying of himſelf: ſo that,</p>
            <p>That under the profeſſion of Love and Religion, there lurks in moſt men baſe and filthy ends &amp; reſpects, whereat they ſpecially aim; which poyſons all, &amp; proves their Love and Religion meerly nothing.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Phariſees</hi> guilty of this, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Simon Mag us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:97089:28"/>1. For this is to frame Religion, to ſerve our ſelves, and not to ſerve God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This argues an unpurged heart, which turns all meat to ill humours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus Religion is made a way to cover, but not to crucifie the World, and our fleshly Luſts &amp; Self-will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And this is plain in experience: What is it that man doth in Religion, but ſome baſe end is more powerful in him to produce it, than the ſimple power of Chriſts love in him? We run after the example of others for credit and approbation, rather than out of ſimple love for our loſt minds. Others talk of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo muſt we; that we may be known: Others shew love, ſo muſt we, that we may be approved: and nothing is ſaid or done, whereat we have not an end of our own: We judge the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and juſtifie our ſelves, and yet do the ſame thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we ſee, what a vain and vile thing mans heart is; that he meddles with nothing, but he mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it: that though the thing be good, and the word good: yet in us it is ill.</p>
            <p n="3">3 No ſimple and hearty Religion indeed, but when man dwells in the ſimplicity of his own heart, &amp; in the ſimple truth: elſe like a huckſter, he makes Religion but as a Trade to gain by, either from God or man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, a woman which was a ſinner:</hi> both in the eye of the World, and in her ſell: judged by both, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in her ſelf: So that,</p>
            <p>None flies to Chriſt in deed and truth, nor finds mercy with him, but he that knows and feels himſelf dayly to be a ſinner: and through ſin, is a loſt &amp; help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creature.</p>
            <p>So the Prodigal and Publicane, and <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. Joh. 1 <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For then death and weakneſſe, wrath &amp; judgement lives in man: &amp; preſſeth him down, and forceth him to cry and to pray.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For elſe man lyes covered from himſelf under
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97089:29"/> ſome figleafe, and ſo flies the judgement; that he may preſerve his fleſhly life alive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This preſerves humility, and keeps down pride, and prepares for mercy; for to theſe only doth the Kingdom of God come. Now this is not a ſeeing of this, &amp; that action amiſs; but that he ſee and feel the Original fountain and guilt: That though all actions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, yet he feels the Power and Inclination, and ſway of his mind againſt G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, &amp; his Truth; that though he be prevented by Gods Power, and ſhall not taſte of Judgement through grace; yet he ſees in himſelf ſuch a power of corruption, &amp; miſguided paſſions, that he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es out for mercy daily, &amp; ſo is faith daily preſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But all men ſtrive to appear both before God and themſelves to be rich, none would be found ſinners: Therefore, when we have miſſed it in one action, we mend it in the next, that we may appear to be righteous</p>
            <p>As, 1. The pure moral honeſty among men, though they have no great matters of Religion to boaſt of; yet even that they offer to God as a Sacrifice for their ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the more devote men, they think they have a heart full of good qualities and diſpoſitions, and ſo cloath themſelves therewith, for their repentance, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, faith, and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They look at, as good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to cover ſin withall: but the only quality that Chriſt loves, is when man comes a ſinner to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. May, others indeed have ſeen themſelves ſinners, but now righteous and holy, and their repenting dayes are forgotten; ſo mercy loſt, &amp; ſaith fails. For as it was ſin, that by accident brought Chriſt into the World, ſo it is ſin in mans heart, that brings a Saviour unto man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others ſee in themſelves weakneſſe and want of Power, that they cannot come to that pitch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; righteouſneſſe that they aim at, which if they could, all would be well: But their rebellious Will, Luſt, and Pride and Worldlineſſe are hid from them. So that it is the hardeſt thing to make a man a ſinner; and to keep him to a daily ſenſe of his own weakneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſin in man, and mercy in God; infidelity
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97089:29"/> in man; and faith in Chriſt, layes a right foundation of Religion; and is the dayly continuance of the life of all Religion in man: for thereby, Prayer, humilitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd ſaith are preſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So that the word never proſpers, but when it lights amongſt ſinful men: The ſelf-righteous have a covering yea, &amp; all are grown cunning to put off the evil day, &amp; make a covenant with hell: for no ſooner doth ſin prick &amp; look out at them, but they have a ſore knowledge of a Saviour, and ſo cure the wound before it be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the heard that Jeſus was at meat.</hi> She being now brought into miſery within her ſelf, and all her ſweet pleaſures turned into gall and worm wood; she ſeeks for caſe and reſt: ſo it will fall out to all: So that,</p>
            <p>That all the pleaſures of joy and peace, that man now enjoyes: in the world and the flesh, will ſooner or later be turned into ſorrow, want and miſery; for death and judgement will lay all in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Where was the confidence that <hi>Paul</hi> had in the flesh, when he was ſtricken down in the way to <hi>Damaſcus?</hi> Where is all the power of <hi>Pharaoh, Pompey,</hi> of <hi>Dives:</hi> and wealth of all worldlings, Luk. 12. Yea, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> are laid in the duſt, Luke 6. <hi>Woe be to you that now laugh, for you shall mourn.</hi> Iſa. 28. <hi>I will make void your Covenant with death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15 For there is a way that ſeems good, but the iſſues thereof are death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Elſe man ſhould inſult over God and Chriſt, &amp; his Word become a lye.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus doth God make way for his mercy and love, that man may be capable thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All joy and life of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be deſtroyed, that Chriſt may live in us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Woe to the merry deceived wordling, who rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in his wealth, friends, pleaſure &amp; reſpect: as this woman did: but behold, She is now brought to weeping cheare. So we make our ſelves merry, &amp; promiſe many happy dayes; but ſure, fear and ſorrow, weakneſſe and miſery muſt firſt come, before man be eſtablished in Peace &amp; Freedom: for this will not laſt: We think eaſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97089:30"/> good while it laſts, and ſo we put off the evil: that we muſt taſte, for we have eaten ſowre grapes, &amp; our teeth muſt be ſet on edge.</p>
            <p>Nay, all our labour &amp; care is to put away ſorrow &amp; fear: &amp; therefore we gather riches, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that vve might ſit above, and ſee no evil: Man would do evil, but would not ſee it: rebell, but not take notice Did ever any rebell againſt his Prince, but he ſmarted for it in the end. And though the King, of meer grace would pardon, yet was he a loſt man in his own eyes: and his pride was laid down in the dungeon: ſo with us: for ſin in man will cauſe ſmart to man firſt or laſt: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though we may put it off through blind preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not regarding what shall follow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or cover our ſelves, and cloſe up our hearts under the bewitching of wordly profits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or to drink down ſorrow like unto beaſts for a while.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or cover our ſelves from the Word of Truth, and ſimplicity of our minds: by our opinions of knowledge ſelf-righteouſneſſe, and the world underneath.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Yet either will the Lord find us out by his Word, and diſcover ſuch a wretchedneſſe to man, as shall make him cry out, <hi>Woe and alace that ever I was born! and that my mothers Womb had been my grave, or that I had been ſtrangled aſſoon as I ſaw the light:</hi> and ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his birth day, as <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Or man runing on to his courſe to the end of his Shadows, Pleaſures, and fools Paradice: at laſt falls into the Pit, where there is nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth: weeping and howling for the dayes of their vanity that are paſt, and cannot be recalled: For the guilt of his Soul preſſeth him down, and cannot be eaſed: when man is entred into Eternal miſery, which shall never be ended. Then alace! shall we ſee, that Husband, and Wife, or Children, were but ſilly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Earth, on which we ſo doted; that Gold and Silver were but Droſſe, which we ſo ſerved: and now all taken from us, and our Life too, never to be reſtored.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97089:30"/>1. No miſery like to the miſery of man; for no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on earth hath ſo rebelled againſt God as he.

            <p>O then! that God would give us hearts to ſee that miſery, that we might mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For what a folly is it for a man to run on in a courſe ſtill, that he knowes will bring ſorrow? like the thief, who bewitched with preſent ſweet, and ſeeding himſelf with hope to eſcape, becomes hardned, and never believes, nor ſees the ſorrowing of his hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And that men in the dayes of mirth would think of the time of mourning: every one ſeeing himſelf even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Chriſt and his Word are only ſweet, and deſired of troubled hearts and wearied minds: but to others, it is weariſome, and little regarded, as Pſal. 119. <hi>I had fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my affliction, but that thy word ſtayed me.</hi> The poor receive the Goſpel, and the halt and blind came wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly at the voice of the Goſpel; and how dear was the Word to the Martyrs in trouble; that one of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles was a treaſure from hand to hand: And what a wonderful power had it amongſt thoſe ſick &amp; blind men, that he but ſpake the Word, and they were made whole.</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="3">3. For none believes it but them; others know it, and talk of it, but the poor and lowly minde only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may then cry with the Prophet, Iſa. 55. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> for every heart is filled and fatted, and born up with ſomething: none lyes under his own burden in the Duſt; but one hath the World, and lives by it: another a witty and ſtrong opinion of Faith and Chriſt: and Chriſt and his Word not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Do we not delight in any Hiſtory, and witty diſcourſe, rather than this: do we not believe &amp; cleave to any lie of Satan, though directly oppoſite; for if he ſay, we ſhall die; We ſay, no, none will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And hence we ſee, what makes all unprofitable unto man, <hi>viz.</hi> Hardneſſe of heart, and preſumption, when man can paſſe over Hell and Death ſo lightly, as not belonging to him; and ſo Chriſt and his Word are a far off kind of thing to him: He can have it, or want it; he had rather want it than a little portion of Wealth; can live merrily in the fullneſſe of the World without the Word, than to want it, though he had Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf daily to Preach.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For man by wit and diligence, is able to help any wound, or heal any miſerie but this: but the biting of the Serpent, none can cure, but the braſen Serpent.</p>

            <p n="2">2. But theſe dayes are paſt, and burden is removed, only by a blind foreknowing of the Goſpel: For when a man is declared to be miſerable, ſtill he hath a voice, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not die: and nothing is made known, but he hath a foreknowing of all: Yea, to the imagined, comprehending of God himſelf: and this hardens more than all elſe.

            <p n="1">1. Hence ariſeth all this covering, and cloaking, and ſeeking of approbation, that we may be ſeen of men: for look what a man thinks, and how he judgeth of himſelf, he would have all men to judge and think the ſame.</p>
            <p>And this ſticks faſt in all, we judge our ſelves better then many others; when we, in ſo judging, are worſt of all, and yet God and thou knows, whether all thy care and labour in Religion, be not as well to gain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as out of the trouble of thine own vileneſſe and weakneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, is there any thing that thou enjoyes, or doth, but there ariſeth a conceit with it, of a betterneſs than before? that becauſe of this good qualitie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> judgeth well: which only shews the goodneſſe of God to man, and not of man towards God, and ſo it is this proud opinion that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. See what a proud thing man is, that though a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet will needs be on horſe-back: Haſt thou any thing that firſt, thou haſt not received it? and then, why boaſteſt thou, as though thou hadſt not received it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Haſt thou any thing properly thine, or, in thine own power; but in the hand of another, or canſt thou ſtand one hour thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doſt thou not marr every thing that thou meddles withall? as the Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though good, yet in thee nought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doſt thou not diſſemble with God, &amp; thy ſelf withall? that when thou Profeſſeſt to truſt God, and ſeek his glory, doſt thou not chiefly truſt Wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeekeſt thy ſelf? when alace I

            <p n="3">3. And, what ever is revealed, and wrought by Chriſt himſelf in his, man hath a cunning tricke to shape the like in conceit: only the one hath them in his head, and the other in his heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not Chriſts Religion that puffs man up, but, that pulls down: that,</p>
            <p>Chriſt may Live in him.

                  <item>1. One ſets up the World &amp; himſelf, and caſts Chriſt off.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. So that, truely to know our ſelves, and not to be beguiled, is a great miſtery; not deſerved, but by him that knows the ſecrets of the heart: For with man he goes for current, when God accounts abominable.</p>
            <p>He would have known who, and what this <hi>Woman had been:</hi> Here together with his pride: in regard of himſelf, he goes a cenſuring of others, even of Chriſt himſelf: and he judged him, becauſe, according unto their Tradition he did not caſt her off; Even indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was merciful to poor ſinners: So that,</p>
            <p>He that out of Ignorance hath a good opinion of himſelf, hath never a good conceit; but a hard ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of others, and hath pity and compasſion on none; he that is not partaker of mercy, never ſhews mercy to any: but judgeth all, even Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> juſtified themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all elſe: not like the <hi>Publican,</hi> Iſa, 65. <hi>Stand by, I am holier than thou.</hi> Col. 2. <hi>Touch not, taſte not,</hi> &amp;c. And thus they accuſed Chriſt: <hi>why eats your Maſter with Publicans?</hi> therefore not a holy man: The elder Brother of the Prodigal, <hi>I have obeyed thy command:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97089:33"/> but this my Brother hath waſted all;</hi> with whoors and harlots.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For pity and compaſſion to others ariſeth, even out of feeling and knowing of miſery and weakneſſe in our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Comparative righteouſneſſe is a great plea, and argument to a rotten heart: nay, man never arrogates any things to himſelf, but he judgeth hardly others: Nor judgeth others, but hath an approving of himſelf, or elſe: why judgeſt thou another, when thou doeſt the ſame, or a worſe thing?</p>
            <p n="3">3. For thoſe men live by Sacrifice, and not by mercy: and therefore will have Sacrifice, and not mercie for it: But Chriſt will have Mercy and not Sacrifice; &amp; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not Righteous.</p>
            <p>And this ariſed out of meer blindneſſe in mans ſelf, which hath covered his filthineſſe with fig-leaves: and ſo tyes Religion to ſome certain qualities and actions: which, whoſo wants, he judgeth: and ſin in man, and mercie in God: which is the foundation of all he feels not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This ſhews there is more <hi>Phariſees</hi> than <hi>Publicans</hi> in the Church: and more that live by ſacrifice, than by mercy, when every one hath a ſtone to caſt at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preying into everie failing: judging out of their own rotten hearts, that to be a fleshly libertie, which flows out of meer love: as here in Jeſus Chriſt: Nay, this we all fall into, in caſting off: or ſecretly judging every one that is not of the ſame way with us: aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the fails and ſlips of others: But, I demand. What ſeeſt thou amiſſe in them, that is not in thee? thou thinks <hi>Judas</hi> a traitor, and art not thou the ſame? how often haſt thou ſold and forſaken Chriſt for leſſe: and cauſed him to be reproached, and ſlandered &amp; crucified: even for the ſatisfying of ſome baſe luſt? but thou ſhalt ſee, when thou feels either his free mercie, or thy own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: that thou wilt judge none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence ariſeth all Sects &amp; Contentions in the Church, even becauſe every one hath a good opinion of himſelf,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97089:34"/> and judgeth all that are not like him; Thus everie Sect condemns others: <hi>But, Chriſt came not to condemn the world, but to ſave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, And this corruption lives in us all: how apt is man to forget himſelf, and fall upon others: not only to judge their way to be evil, but their very eſtates with God. If God bring us before his judgement ſeat, who is able to abide?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And thus we judge Chriſt and his Word, and are not judged by it; we frame it to our own mould, &amp; are not framed by it: as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> judged Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, becauſe he was not more ſevere againſt her: would have had Chriſt to have been a man of wrath, &amp; judgement, and not a mediator for Sinners.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But Chriſts Religion is a humble, pitiful, &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Religion: which indeed is the life of it: For this man had Knowledge: and alſo Righteouſneſſe: but no mercy nor love: which proved all to be nothing: <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Simon. Simon.</hi> Here, he firſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſecret hypocriſie of the <hi>Phariſee:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Though man walk unblemeably in the eyes of all, and religiouſly and holily in his own eyes: yet, in the higheſt perfection of man, God hath ſomewhat to ſay unto him.</p>
            <p>As the young man, <hi>Thou yet lakeſt one thing;</hi> and to <hi>Saul, What meaneth the bleating of the Sheep:</hi> The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> thought themſelves ſafe, but Chriſt had ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Word of Truth ſearcheth the ſecrets of the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God judgeth and condemns that which man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves: Yea, he will bring all to judgement, &amp; conclude all under ſin, that no flesh may glory: for all mouths muſt be ſtopped, and none able to juſtifie himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So that all our ſecret hidings and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers will not ſerve: God hath ſtill ſomething to ſay to us: though we ſtrive to make all ſo ſure, that he might not accuſe us: yet all in vain: for we know that when we have hardened our hearts in ſecurity, yet God; either by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97089:34"/> Teſtimonies of guilt, or by his Word and Truth, is ſtill pulling by the ſlieve: &amp; though we ſlip away, yet he will diſcover at laſt.</p>
            <p>Two things keeps all men out of Chriſt, under a kind of cover:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either Beaſtly, or <hi>Epicurian</hi> ſecuritie; Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Phariſaical</hi> pride: either man is drowned in the World, or Prided in conceits, and hardened in both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But know, God will bring to light every ſecret thing, though we put off, and care not to meddle with him: though we flatter, &amp; think to pleaſe him: though we be righteous, and think to ſtand before him, yet he hath ſomewhat to ſay:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A certain man had two debtors.</hi> Here under a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he shews t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſtate of all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in Ch iſt: The firſt in the two debtors, that are not able to pay: and ſo bound over to death and bondage: The ſecond, in free grace, forgiving both: with the effect of love thereupon. <hi>Two debtors, the one owing five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, the other fifty:</hi> This difference he ſpeaks according to <hi>Simons</hi> judgement: for he juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before her, as much as five hundred differs from fifty: though in reſpect of God, and Original guilt, all are alike. Yet in the eye of the World, and by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying actual tranſgreſſion, increaſed the guilt &amp; bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and ſo did differ; but both debtors, as all men are: So that,</p>
            <p>All men, yea, every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> through Original ſin &amp; guilt of everie heart, are debtors to God: and bound over to death and deſtruction: which we muſt pay, and ſuffer, unleſſe Gods mercy and free grace in Chriſt do free us, Rom. 3. <hi>We have all ſinned and are equally deprived of the glory of God.</hi> Eph. 2. <hi>We are all by nature the children of Wrath.</hi> Rom. 13.2. <hi>There is a law of Sin and Death from which we are fred, only by the Law of the Spirit in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> &amp;c. And to <hi>Adam, In the day that thou eats thereof, thou shalt die,</hi> Rom. 14.1. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> And ſee it in the Prodigal.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97089:35"/>1. The Law of righteouſneſſe, which God cannot forſake, requires it: that he that will not live in God, shall have no life: as to <hi>Adam:</hi> Much more, he that would in his heart pull God out of his Throne, and ſit there himſelf: as <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. All men in <hi>Adam;</hi> are ſo eſtranged from God in the ground of their hearts, that they are direct fighters againſt God in all things: for when we ſhould truſt, love; fear &amp; obey him; mans heart forſakes him, and runs to every thing rather.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For if there were not a debt and poverty to be ſuffered, there needed no forgiveneſſe: But we pray daily, <hi>forgive us our debts, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay, all men know this: and therefore, flie from God and his judgement, as the debtor from his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; who, though for the preſent he is quiet, and hath enough: yet debt and fear lyes on him for future times, becauſe he knows a reckoning day will come; ſo we: Yea, the very Heathen fear this, that believe the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Soul, and labour by moral righteouſneſſe to pay the debt, but all in vain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And know that this debt and death his not this or that miſguided action: but the very original ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountain of rebellion, &amp; guilt in the heart: whence ſpring all theſe little ſtreams from that great and filthy Fountain. For all actual ſins are properly againſt men, which may be diſcharged: As, if I wrong any man, I may reſtore and make a mends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by this a mans heart fights againſt God daily: as, when he ſaith he is juſt &amp; powerful, &amp; fears not; but thinks to shift it, that he is merciful, &amp; we need it not: but ſhall live in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and will mend the matter, and pay him his own.</p>
            <p>But the believing heart that knows himſelf, is ſtill a debtor, becauſe that he feels, that although he guide well, &amp; be prevented from many actual Rebellions, and be partaker of Gods grace, that he shall not taſte of judgement: yet, he feels ſuch a ſpring of Rebellions &amp; miſ guided paſſions, that he is ſtill a debtor, and daily cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:97089:35"/>
            <p>O! What a vile and miſerable thing is man, and yet dreams of no ſuch thing, Other creatures owe debt to man, and daily live in ſervice and ſubjection, and pay it; and when they die, all is diſcharged: But man lives in joy &amp; freedom; &amp; when he dies, all is to pay, <hi>and he caſt into utter darkneſſe, to pay the uttermoſt farthing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whence then is all this pride, and vain boaſting? whence is all this Sleepineſſe, Security and Peace in the World? whence is this judging and cenſuring of others? whence is this boaſting and high thoughts of our gifts, and abilities? Is not bondage our daily bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and death and miſery the portion that we look for &amp; fear. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> cry out for deliverance from <hi>the body of this death,</hi> and yet we live in life, and ſeeks no deliverance: Was not he a dead man in himſelf, and Chriſt lived in him, and yet we alive to our ſelves, and Chriſt dead to us. Therefore, till man believe and know this, not by diſcourſe, but believing the word of Truth, and finding it in himſelf, he believes nothing at all, &amp; if man believe this, it would lay him as the duſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and dash all toyes, and joyes in the World, &amp; make him pitiful to others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But alace! man turns all believing into Fleſhly knowing, &amp; thereby keeps off his own miſery: like a drunken man, that beſots himſelf, that he may eaſe himſelf a while of the fear of that debt he cannot pay: For this fore-knowing of man, prevents believing: and ever lifts up man, never pulls him down, makes him righteous in himſelf, not a ſinner; hardens the heart, but never humbles it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But know, that man muſt know &amp; feel this one day; when it will be too late, when he shall know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſery, like a debtor in the Guoile, who runs his miſ-pent time, muſt not ſee his friends, nor walk abroad, but pine to death, &amp; ſorrow: ſo with us at death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when they had nothing to pay.</hi> Here comes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſery, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is left to no man power to free himſelf: So that,</p>
            <p>No power nor poſſibility in man, by any witty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, high ſpeculation, or higheſt holineſſe, to free
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97089:36"/> his mind of guilt: to eaſe his bondage, to flie miſery o eſcape death; but in the ſenſe of all weakneſſe &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, to cry daily for mercy; and wait for deliverance in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are redeemed not with corruptible things,</hi> &amp;c. So the Prodigal; And becauſe there was no power in man, he laid help on one that was mighty among the People; wherefore elſe came Chriſt into the World; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was none elſe able <hi>to tread the Wine preſſe of his wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the wiſdom of man is foolishneſſe, &amp; his ſtrength weakneſſe; his righteouſneſſe as a filthy rag; His ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice abominable; Iſrael was not able to help themſelves at the Read-Sea,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, the promiſe runs upon ſuch, <hi>as have no money, or heavy laden, blind, and poor in Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For Till man have nothing in himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf, Chriſt hath nothing for him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then is grace, and God magnified; his Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; but, while man hath any poſſibility in himſelf, or hope in any creature: mercie is little ſet by.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Away then with all thoſe s ilts of man, to put off the evil day: as 1. One with the full World: he will drown all miſery in the Earth: but when the Earth shall be taken away, where then is his portion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another with moral honeſty, thinks it will do ſomething.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more devote, offers fat ſacrifices of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to purge ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another thinks, the time was, when he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but now he hath ſomewhat, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe he thinks will go far; but Repentance is hid from his eyes: and Faith &amp; Mercie shut up.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another takes time, &amp; promiſeth to pay hereafter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another payes old, and takes new: as new fashions in Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus man loath to live in weakneſſe, and have hold of nothing, but feeds ſecuritie with ſome hope or other,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97089:36"/> and looking at himſelf, hopes that all that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and commits not to free mercie. This is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, when man lives in his own miſerie indeed, and ſees no way to get out: it brings him to wait for mercie onely: Like the debtor brought on his knees, commits himſelf to the mercy of the creditor: So, that indeed, mans weakneſſe is his ſtrength: the Croſſe his Freedom, Suffering his victorie, &amp; Death his Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where then is the power of man, that we ſo much talk off? Is it in man? a talent given to man to pay his own debt; Nay, to manifeſt his grace: and it ſhews how mercy in God is the dayly life of man, and not in himſelf, and our help in another: Yea, and it magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his mercie, that takes a Wife of fornication: that hath no good qualitie: as this Woman: and to ſuch vile and weak Rebels ſhews favour, that the glory may be his alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He forgave them both.</hi> Here is the Goſpel, and free Grace of God unto miſerable man: that had no way to turn him, but falls down, &amp; confeſſeth the debt: for he exacts nothing at them, nor enters into judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which of them will love him moſt.</hi> Here he propones the queſtion to convince him in himſelf So that,</p>
            <p>Till man be convinced in himſelf, truely to ſee his own vileneſſe &amp; wretchedneſſe, all truth is but as a shadow without ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſtood juſtified in themſelves, the Goſpel was in vain, Chriſt came to reprove the World, and ſo to make way for the Goſpel: The Word is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to convince and reprove.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the firſt thing it works, it brings man into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it did this Woman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel is given to none, but to miſerable men: For though others conceive, talk, and diſpute of it, only theſe do believe it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then man cloaths himſelf with it, and hides un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but is not brought under the power of it: to yeild, and lay his hand on his mouth: For he is wiſe above the Word.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97089:37"/>1. And hence it is, that the Word is ſo lightly paſſed over, every man is wiſe to keep off the blow: &amp; though it enters his head, yet he keeps out of his heart: &amp; will not be guilty unleſſe for fashion: And ſo for an lowly, loſt mind: we have a thouſand wiſe and ſecure hearts hardned through knowledge: For we have gotten a foreknowing of all Truth, and keeps off repentance; that when ever the wound of ſin is diſcovered, we have readie a plaiſter, by fore knowing before the wound be made, and ſo Religion is made a meer matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement: For they ſee a remedie before the ſore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And hence ſee, that if mans heart believingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Word of Truth, it will put all men to ſilence; none is able to ſtand before it, or to argue againſt it; It leaves all men guilty and none righteous, But when man gets upperhand of the Word, and gets it under his witt: it makes all righteous in conceit, &amp; none ſinners: as 1, by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who cares for the ſparrows and lillies? doth not the heavenly Father? Why then do you care;</hi> ſaying, <hi>what shall we eat?</hi> &amp;c. Here all men are guilty, none able to ſay, his heart is clean.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is Chriſt the Son of God, and hath Chriſt done that which never man did? <hi>and no man ſpake like this man?</hi> Why then do we not believe? but he believes every lye of Satan: So that out of our own mouth and heart he will judge us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So that one word believed with a ſimple heart, prevails more than the whole Bible, only known of a hard, and fleshly wiſe mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which will love him moſt.</hi> Or he: <hi>to whom he forgave moſt:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Look what Chriſt is to man, even the ſame is man to Chriſt, &amp; to others, and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>We love him, becauſe he loved us. Firſt, the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us. <hi>For Chriſt lives in me:</hi> So that he only gives life in all things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For if Chriſt dwell but in mans fancie, then he hath only a fancie, and an opinion of Love, Righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97089:37"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For what ever rules in the mind; all the whole powers run thither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For what a man is, or doth of himſelf; he is, and doth for himſelf, and it is meer nothing, though he gave his body to be burned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus Chriſt shews his Power in man, mortifies man to the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And man as an inſtrument to do his will, as in everie Officer of the Kingdom, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by the King.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where then is that power and that wiſdom to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mans heart, to rule his paſſions, to frame his mind to the will of God, to mortifie Luſt? Is it in mans good husbandrie; no? It is in mans lying dead in himſelf; wearie of himſelf, waiting for help, and finding help in another; is loſed at the bottome, and loves Chriſt and all men; not out of any good qualitie in nature, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified mind through his diligence: but that unknown power of the love of God ruling in man, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates man from himſelf and his own glorie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this diſcovers a main want of lively Religion, &amp; harty Love, when in every thing a man meddles with, he ſtill hath an eye to himſelf, his own ends makes him forward: his own power &amp; wiſdom guides him: &amp; his own good he looks at: Nay, when Chriſt hath freed the mind, how ſoon returns man to himſelf, and begins the good thereby to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And this shews that Chriſt lives in few: when we ſee that cankered malice, covetouſneſſe, pride, envy: and whole brood of luſts fighting in man: See, <hi>He that loves Father or Mother, more than me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, All mens hearts without Chriſt are like to this mans: a cold complemental courteſie, eſteeming well of Chriſt: but better of himſelf, a reſerved affection without life, for neither do they ſtand in need of him, nor feel any goodneſſe by him, where he onlie lives not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She hath much forgiven her, and therefore she loves much.</hi> Here is the cauſe and effect of Chriſt forgiving her ſins, and she loving Chriſt: ſo that,</p>
            <p>An heart truly troubled and loſt in himſelf, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97089:38"/> remiſsion of ſins in and by Chriſt: loves and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to him above all things in the world or himſelf: and all men in and for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemed nothing but Chriſt, Phil. 3.7. Mat. 10.37. <hi>He that loves Father or mother:</hi> &amp;c. 1. Cor. 16.22. <hi>He that loves not Chriſt, let him be Anathema.</hi> The diſciples being ſtricken with this Doctrine, forſook all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For there is no life left in any thing to man, either in the world or himſelf, but only in him: as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal: What is all gold &amp; riches to an hungry Stomack, in compariſon of bread? So, What is all the World to a loſt heart in reſpect of Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. For nothing is, or can be ſuch a burden, and death to the heart, as ſin and guilt: and ſo, nothing like free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; life, as forgiveneſſe. O, how ſweet is the voice of a pardon to a condemned man! Now, we all ſay, that we love Chriſt: But know, it is the mighty power of God, in the truth of his Word, that ſeparates man from himſelf, and all things to Chriſt alone: for while when any thing elſe gives hope, delight, joy, eaſe or peace to man: Chriſt is not regarded, but in opinion only.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For there is a loving of Chriſt after the flesh: as the Diſciples: who could not abide to hear of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo we have fleshly, cold affections to the notions of Chriſt, but not to be ruled and guided, and live by him only, but will be quartermaſters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And there is a love to the eaſe, and peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by him, which we would ſtill have: and fit at his right hand, or for works ſake, but to love him: and eſteem him for poverty, want, forſaken, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we like not: Like a heartleſſe wife, that loves and obeyes her husband, ſo long as he pampers hers and keeps her fair and fine: But when he falls into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, forſakes him, and takes another; as the rich <hi>Lawyer</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> did.</p>
            <p>So that Chriſt may well ſay, <hi>Who hath believed our report, or to whom is the power of Chriſts death effectual?</hi> Seing, all are ſo knit to the World and our ſelves, that he and his word is not regarded.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97089:38"/>1. The World we love, as Father, Mother, Eaſe, Fulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe darken the heart, and gives ſuch a peace to the flesh, that we ſee not the miſerie of our Spirits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We love our own fancies, and thoughts &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and qualities, and think theſe will help us, and plead for us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We love our ſelves, and any thing that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our fleshly Kingdom; but the Kingdom of Chriſt we caſt off.</p>
            <p n="1">1 One rather than want his will; another, rather than want the World; another, rather than want eaſe and life, ſets Chriſt aſide: So that we may ſay? How dwells the love of God in theſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſee, Chriſt is eſteemed and loved of none, but miſerable and ſinful men in themſelves: who though he k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll them, yet they will love him: theſe tread all under foot all righteouſneſſe, for they ſee none; all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the World, Eaſe and Peace, and Chriſt only is life unto them: And beſides him, all things works their bondage: yea, are weariſome, as all men are to a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, but her husband.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Away then with all Religion, where love is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: all talking and working, where man doth it to cover his filthineſſe; with them: Chriſt is a judge, and they cannot love him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And none loves Chriſt, that loves himſelf: for only ſuch as condemn and judge themſelves, eſteem of him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And this appears in love to your neighbour, even of mankind, our very enemies: which appears in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting freely with the World: helping the needful, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving injuries, covering infirmities of others; ſuffering willingly: elſe, how dwells the love of Chriſt in us?</p>
            <p n="6">6. So that it is not love that is the form of Faith, but faith begets love: &amp; love expreſſeth faith to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Free forgiveneſſe of ſins in Chriſt, to a troubled heart, is life in death, and the door and life of all hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:97089:39"/>
            <p>Having forgiven us all our treſpaſſes, This was life in the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and to the <hi>Publicane:</hi> And this <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>This is our bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For till then, the Partition-wall ſtands, and man ſits in death in himſelf, or life in the world only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This opens the door of the Covenant unto man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is the daily life of man, who though he daily ſin, yet God in Chriſt, freely forgives, and this bruſts his heart, and makes it melt into love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But moſt enter not in at this door, but leap over this, &amp; take for granted, what they never felt nor enjoyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others, offer ſacrifice to purge ſin, and cover with righteouſneſs, wiſdom &amp; opinion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But O, What a life is this to a dead man, as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner condemned, yet obtains pardon through the mercy of a Prince?</p>
            <p>And this forgiveneſſe is the free mercy of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving mans ſin, for his own Names ſake, not becauſe, they are leſſer or fewer, nor becauſe we repent, &amp; now turn, nor becauſe, we are more righteous, or for good qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who is this that forgiveth ſins?</hi> Here they begin to judge him again, becauſe he forgiveth ſin: they looked that he should have judged &amp; excommunicated her, or ſet her to keep the Law, and wrought her own peace.</p>
            <p>No ſaith he, <hi>I came to ſave, and not to judge ſinners and loſt man:</hi> But this was a Principle that they favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, ſo that,</p>
            <p>Unbelieving, Strait-hearted, Hard-hearted, &amp; Self-religious Men, though in Wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, they excell others: yet have they leaſt favour or feeling of repentance and forgiveneſſe, wherein the life of all Religion conſiſts.</p>
            <p>They tithe the Mint, Anniſe and Cummin; they look to the plucking of the ears of Corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, but mercy, they are not acquainted with, Mic. <hi>They offer thouſands of rams,</hi> &amp;c. But to walk humbly with their God, they know not. The firſt, they urge with all vehemency, but the latter, they never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97089:39"/>1. For, what is in mans power, by diligence; by his own ends he obtains: but, what is Gods free gift, as this; he hath not faith to embrace?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do well, and have well; is the Principle all ſtick to: but reſting in Chriſt, when all things are loſt, is a myſtery, known to none, but he that hath it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The worldling hath no life, but in the World: and knows not, what forgiveneſſe and burden of ſin is: So,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> know all, and do all: but forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faith he ſavours not; therefore, judgeth this to be carnal liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All <hi>Sectaries,</hi> buſie themſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. So we talk and think of Religion, and run into many diſputs, and circumſtances: and over-leap the foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="5">5. None knows the Power of Religion in deed, but he that hath it; not in himſelf, as a quality; but in Chriſt, by faith.</p>

            <p>AFter that Chriſt had caſt off the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the preceeding <hi>Chapter,</hi> &amp; received the Woman; whereby he manifeſted the freeneſſe of Gods grace, without any reſpect unto man. Great multitudes flocked to him, out of all Cities: and he lets them ſee by a Parable, that all hearers prove not Chriſtians. Wherein note, 1. The occaſion, much people met him 2. The Parable it ſelf. 3. The Expoſition thereof: <hi>Much people were gathered together.</hi> Partly, by his Miracles; partly, the power of his word; partly, for cuſtome: but all came, and yet after you ſee, fall off: So that,</p>
            <p>The voice of the Goſpel, and the publiſhing of it, gets many friends and followers at the firſt; which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97089:40"/> afterwards fall off, &amp; forſake it, Joh. 6. <hi>When all was gone, his diſciples began to ſlink: and he ſaid, Will you alſo go away.</hi> It was great heart burning to the Prieſts and Elders, that the whole world went after Chriſt, &amp; yet at the end, all forſooke him: <hi>and he trode the wine-preſſe alone:</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> had many Children and Churches, Gal. 4. <hi>You would have plucked out your own eyes, but they all forſooke him, and turns to the falſe Apoſtles: thus beginning in the Spirit, and ending in the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For, <hi>Eſt natura hominum novitatis avida:</hi> but when they have tryed it, and find not that ſweet they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but that it croſſeth their luſts and wordly Kingdom, and ſuits not with their eaſe and reſt; they forſake it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Many embrace and approve of it for company, and moe forſake it for company: it may be the example of many will draw one to it: but the example of one will draw many from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though man think, that a Nation is born at once: yet few truly proves good ground, and ſticks to the end: for he that endures to the end, is ſaved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is too plain in experience, What zeal and forwardneſſe, what diligence and care, is now dead and ended in nothing? and though once we wanted nothing but Chriſt, yet now have forſaken him in the way of his croſs, and eaſe our ſelves in the world, and our own devices.</p>
            <p>So that, the life of the Goſpel continues but a time: for after a while, ſecurity takes hold of ſome opinions and hereſies of others: and the world takes hold of all: and ſo the Lord takes it away, and ſends it elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the perverſe nature of man, who is never wearie of the world in the ways of the fleſh: and yet how ſoon weary of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſpake by a Parable:</hi> Not in high and abſtruſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, or wittie and unknown Language, but in plain parables, as of plowing &amp; ſowing, of ſalt, and three pecks of meal, of loſt ſheep, of debtors and creditors: things well known unto men, &amp; caſt this ſimple ſeed amongſt them; where, ſee the nature of the Goſpel: So that,</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:97089:40"/>
            <p>That it is plain &amp; low, &amp; ſimple; wants nothing, but believing hearts to make it known: yet not underſtood of any, but ſuch as ſtand truly in need thereof.</p>
            <p>Many great Doctors were ignorant of theſe Parables: the Parable was plain but the myſteries was hid. Many wiſe men conceive truly of it, &amp; defended it: but only miſerable men knew the power of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Chriſt came not to ſet men at diſputing about opinions, but about themſelves: to draw them to believe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So that divinity ſtands not in curious ſearching of hidden things, but in plain evidence of truth, to pierce the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And hence we ſee, what good doth all thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of high knowledge, of contemplative men, <hi>viz.</hi> The greateſt Idolaters, that ever was in the Church: for they frame ſteps and ſtairs, to aſcend to high Myſteries; and frame a God at the top: and yet, ly in pride and baſe luſts: God gives us low and humble hearts, &amp; then a Parable will fet: the Goſpel will be precious: and if ever God bring us to ſee the need of Chriſt, one ſimple word of truth will bring more joy, than a thouſand witty diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſower went forth to ſow.</hi> And this ſeed is the Word of God, which proſpers in ſome better, in ſome worſe: and Chriſt therein ranks all men, according to that power the word hath in them; ſo that,</p>
            <p>Every man is with God, as the word is to him,<note place="margin">Joh. 15</note> 
               <hi>If you abide in me, and my word abide in you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> caſt away the Word of the Lord, therefore, the Lord caſt him away: and all the complaints againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſtill, becauſe they hearkned not to my Word: they diſobeyed my Word: and all the Plagues that ever came on man, even from <hi>Adam,</hi> till now is, becauſe our own wills and luſts rules us, &amp; not his Word: we believe not: but <hi>David</hi> lived thereby. And this is that frees man, thy Word of Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For God and his Word are one, ſuch as his Word is to us, ſuch is God in every thing: for not one jote of his Word ſhall fail.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:97089:41"/>2. And all the Word is nothing elſe, but a Declaration of the Fathers will in Chriſt: as the Law, that we should have no Saviour but him, and the Goſpel: that he is a perfect Saviour: &amp; all our ſin is but a transgreſſion of this Word, by making to our ſelves in conceit, other Saviours than him. This is the Word that was given to <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. and this is a mighty Word, <hi>for by it all things were made and preſerved.</hi> As with man, how deadly is the Word of a King in wrath: that it hath ever ſtrucken a man with death? and ſo of mercy. And the ſowing of this ſeed, is nothing elſe: but the faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Gods Will concerning Man and Chriſt, that man may ſee the deceits of Satan by that Word, &amp; ſo be brought to repentance: &amp; may ſee the truth of the Word in Chriſt, that the Kingdom of God may come.</p>
            <p>And yet Chriſt may ſay, <hi>Who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:</hi> when we ſee this ſeed to periſh, &amp; not regarded, but caſt off as a fable: We believe &amp; fear the Word of Man: and the Word of a Father prevails with a Son: but God calls &amp; cries, and we regard not: He threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and we fear not: He promiſeth, and we believe not: But let the World threaten, we fear, or promiſe, and we rejoice: and ſo comes man to be of a worldly heart. Doth not the Father caſt out the Son that regarded not his Word. Mark, and we shall ſee, that the whole ear is ſtopt to this Word: and he is but a dead hearted man: But know, that God hath punished more for this, than all other ſins in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Woe then to the deaf ear and hard heart of man, that can neither hear, nor believe what God ſaith; ſo that to ſome we ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is but a fable, and a thing of no account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others, reverence it: and ſeek to know, and cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> themſelves under it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others, are ſtricken with the Glory and Majeſty thereof: but fleeing to their own Inventions, are cured and flie high above it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others, are filled and revived, and live by it only: not minding, what the world or the flesh ſaith: but what Chriſt ſaith.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97089:41"/>2. So then, that which moſt oppoſeth the Devil, is the Word of the Goſpel: he can deal with all but this: but this diſcovers his dephts: and draws men out of his Kingdom, And if it live not in man, then Satans Word lives in him: either that of the Serpent to <hi>Adam,</hi> or that of God prevails, and we live thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But know, this will be a heavie word one day to thoſe that now caſt it off, &amp; prefer their own Luſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, when the day comes, that the World &amp; all fails man, &amp; with thoſe. Luke 13. <hi>We knock,</hi> &amp;c. He shall ſay, I gave you my Word, I ſent you my Prophets, I told you by them, that you were deceived, &amp; that the World would beguile you: I ſent you my Son to make known my will, he walked in the way before you: I gave him Power and Wiſdom, to guide you by his Word unto Life: I told you, there was no Saviour to man, but only he</p>
            <p>But this Word you deſpiſed, and would not regard: You believed me not, but counted me a lyer: you truſted the World, &amp; the Wiſdom of the Flesh: I would have performed Life to the uttermoſt, but you truſted me not: but counted Chriſt a deceiver: Therefore, now your blood be upon your own heads, and now that Word which you have caſt away; muſt judge you: For my Word muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Happie he then that lives by his Word, and in whom it lives, for all things elſe alter and change; yet this abides, if man ſtick to it, Though for the preſent, we feel no ſweet to the Flesh, yet in time, it comforts the Spirit, and yet how often do we call it a lie, and judge the Word, and are not judged by it, either fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to our own wills, or lifted up above it, or baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk down from it, but every way forſaking it, when indeed it is the ſure foundation to be waited on, untill the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe, <hi>&amp;:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They by the way ſide.</hi> Theſe are four ſorts of men in the Church.</p>
            <p>The 1. Are like the high way, which is ſo troden by the dayly path of men, that it is hardned, and the Seed can take no root therein: Such are in the Church; So that,</p>

            <p>Thoſe in whom the World, and Luſts hath a daily &amp; continual path and cuſtome, becomes ſo hardned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the Goſpel takes little effect with them.</p>

               <hi>of the hardneſſe of thy heart:</hi> So <hi>Iſrael, they erred in heart:</hi> becauſe of the hardneſſe of their hearts. Chriſt was caſt out of their Towns, Pſal. 81. Pſal. 78. <hi>Wondrous things did he in the Land of Ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things chiefly harden; ſelf-love, &amp; ſelf-wiſdom: For, when man is lifted up in conceit and opinion in doing ſomething to God, and not poor and begerly to receive, he ſends the Rich emptie away. For the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, is not what we ſhould do to God, but what we ſhould receive from him?</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Goſpel is ſoft, and lowlie, and tender, and muſt be ſown in tender hearts of Fleſh: The Law was written in ſtone: but the Goſpel in the hearts of Fleſh: This hardneſſe is nothing, but the cloſing up of the mind in ſelf-love; or of the creatures, and depending thereon; loving, living, and delighting therein, ſo that Mercy in Chriſt is deſpiſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence ſee, why the Goſpel proſpers not, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardneſſe of our Hearts: becauſe, that we neither feel our own miſery, nor truſt in Gods mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſo confident, and cloſed up in themſelves; that they trample the Word and Chriſt under foot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others know and comprehend it, but hard and bound at the bottom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others diſpute and talk of it from a hard heart, no faith, no bowels of mercy; but talk as Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Scripture, and ſo nothing but unprofitable found, and pride and vain glory are the bellowes that blows it: and in all theſe we ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſeek themſelves in all things, their own glory and good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have no Mercy nor Pity for others miſery, except partial, in reſpect of their own way and glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They cenſure, judge and condemn all but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The World and the loſſe thereof ſticks deep, but not the Word. For our own miſery and mercy in Chriſt, only breaks the Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee then whom only the Word profits, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97089:43"/> Tender Hearts, that ly lowe, melting in Miſery and Love: theſe pity others: theſe are killed and made alive by the Word, as in Chriſt, who mourned for the Peoples hardneſſe, was partaker of mans miſery: and yet ſaw Mercy of the Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So that all Knowledge, all Paſſions with a hard heart are nothing, and nothing more hardens than that</p>
            <p n="4">4. And all things proſper, according to the diſpoſition of the Heart, learning <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the works of man; but ſaith and a broken heart, the gift of God only.</p>
            <p>This Word may and doth worke many Paſſions, &amp; a light belief in many: and yet never partaker of Chriſt therein, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>They heard and shewed love.</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> did many things; for the Knowledge thereof is glorious and the evidence of the Truth convinceth man, to make him inexcuſable. But theſe are but Firſt, Stirring of natural paſſions. Second, Or, informing Reaſon more clearly. Many ſuch Paſſions we ſee ſtirr'd up; and all nothing: So that, fits &amp; paſſions, lights and eaſements come and go: but miſery in man, and mercy in God remains ever. And the life of faith, is not any ſtrength or quality in man; but a tender heart, &amp; open ear, to hear &amp; believe Gods Word, &amp; live thereby.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter, the <hi>Prophet</hi> firſt bewails the loſſe of the Righteous of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was not laid to heart; but they preſumed ſtill of their own ſtrength with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.

For nothing can deſtroy the hope of man, but God, by the power of his Truth, and ſenſible Wrath in mans heart: man can ſhufle and ſhift off any thing elſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For if guilt be revealed, yet there is hope: For he will mend his courſe, falter <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo hope for mercie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If affliction and croſſe come, yet he will be more warry and diligent, and ſo prevent or recover it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Death come yet he puts it off as long as he can, and ſaith, While there is yet Life there is hope of mends.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For there is ſuch a ſure covenant betwixt the World and mans Fleshlie Heart: that if one faill, he runs to another, and if one conceit hold not, he gets another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus.</hi> Thus doth the Wordlie heart of man wear out his dayes in wearineſſe, and ſtill feeds his vain hopes: How hath the youthful mind wearied himſelf, in one vanitie after another, that now, they are wearineſſe to him, and if the old man were kept to thoſe youthfull dallyance, it would be a burden: And yet, though there was hope in riches: and, how hath the rich Worldling fed his hopes with pulling down and building: and yet he is too ſhort: Nay, there is nothing but is wearineſſe in all our wayes, and yet we follow them, as though in the end, whe should gain reſt: So lothe is man to leave the purſuit of his fleshlie hopes, &amp; ſo little heart to bear the want thereof; That he will trye the utmoſt of his ſtrength, before he yeeld.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97089:44"/>2. Nay, See the wearie paſſages man hath in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and yet will not denie himſelf: he hath gained knowledge, wrought righteouſneſſe, changed his courſe, and all to beget a Faith: and yet his heart is fearful and diſtruſtful, and thinks by a new device or degree, to gain it; Nay, how often hath God confounded thy ſelf-opinions and conceits, that thou ſaw it would not ſerve the turn, and yet, haſt ſet a fresh upon a new one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, how often hath God fruſtrate the fleſhlie conceits of believers, and yet, they have not learned to truſt him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus the Flesh ſtill deceives, for the witt of man shews him many great wayes of thriving, &amp; all proves wearie: great wayes of believing, and yet proves vain opinion: Man will have hold of ſomething, that his hope may be preſerved: Thus is he ſtill bewitched, &amp; will not underſtand the fear of the Lord.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The way of fleshlie knowledge, and high contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: is a great and ſeeming way of happineſs: yet, an enemie to the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The way of ſelf-holineſſe and good qualities, and

            <p n="6">6. And here we ſee, what an evil reſts in the heart of man; like a predominant diſeaſe, overcomes all medicines. There is nothing that God doth to him, or that he enjoyes, but this evil deſtroyes it both: that evil diſpoſition overcomes it, and the evil of miſerie falls upon him; which all his witt, and weary toiling cannot avoide.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he meddle with the Word, there is an evil Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and Luſt that eats it out: and yet, he ſaith, There is no hope.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he pray: there is an evil of ſelfneſſe and pride that conceives hope from what he doth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If he ſeek to know and comprehend, yet, there is an evil ſtubbornneſſe, that he will not yield.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If he get the World, there is an evil of guilt and want that deſtroyes his hope and confidence: Nay, there is no evil befals man, but there is a greater with man which he ſees not, but covers all he can: untill God take him from himſelf, and make him a new man in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet ſaideſt thou not, There is no hope.</hi> Yet thou bleſſedſt thy ſelf in new aid, and not brought to ſeek help at me: So that,</p>
            <p>Till all mans hope in the flesh be deſtroyed, the help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> God in mercy; never relieves him.</p>
            <p>As with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and thoſe in the Ship, <hi>Lord, ſave us, we perish.</hi> The hope that <hi>David</hi> had in his high mountain, turned away the face of God, and in numbering the People 72. <hi>He was paſt hope in himſelf, that he hoped to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the Living.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> was ſtrong in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For till then, man never prayes nor ſeeks to God in earneſt: but to the World, and to the Arm of Flesh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For this ſights againſt faith more than all, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo oppoſite.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For this is the proper effect of the truth, to deſtroy the fleshly hopes in mans heart: and to root it out, that he may ſeek to another.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:97089:45"/>4. For till then, man never denies himſelf, till he be ſenſible of his real miſery; and ſees and finds no help in the World, or himſelf, to avoide it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the poor eaſe the World hath, is to nourish his hope; for all the good he hath is nothing, but feeding him: ſelf with hopes of more good: and ſo long as he can keep this conceit alive in his heart, he will not trouble God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See the ground of his hopes. Firſt, One hath the World, or thinks to get it; and therefore, he hopes, he shall not want: But <hi>David</hi> hoped, becauſe God was his Shepherd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another hath Religion and the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hopes, he shall do well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another, he hath much light, and many feelings of joy, and he thinks, that all will be well; but none hopes in God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See the endleſſe goodneſſe of God, that in croſſing, bleſſeth them; and in deſtroying hope, ſtablisheth them in him ſelf, when the reſtleſſe heart is paſt hope: ſaying, I have gotten the World, and looked to my wayes: but the Rebellion of my heart is that, I have no hope: Then ſaith God, If thou haſt no hope in the World, nor in thy Self; then hope in Me.</p>

            <p>How often doth he urge this in the <hi>Prophets?

            <p n="1">1. All other things are but deceivable ſnares of Satan,

            <p n="2">2. All things live by him onlie, much more mans Soul, which hath no life in any thing elſe, as the body hath.</p>

            <p n="4">4. And God and the Faithful are joyned, and made one in Spirit like Father and Child, Husband &amp; Wife, ſo that, offer what thou wilt: they cry none, but my Father and my Husband.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. So that Faith is a ſimple and ſingle hearted thing; caſts off all power, wiſdom, and good of all things, but this only; and like a chaſte Wiſe, cleaves onlie to her husband; and cryes out, with <hi>David</hi> againſt all Satans temptations:</p>

            <p>For, while God was a God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all Nations fled before them, and feared them, no want nor miſerie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed them; but they were filled to the full with all good and ſatietie: and while man ſits under his shadow ſimplie, he is ſafe: he needs no power of man to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him: nor riches to fill him: For he hath a joy, peace, and riches, and goodneſſe, that the World knows not off, becauſe it knows not him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let everie man try, who is the Lord and God of his Soul.

            <p n="1">1. No marvel then, though we have but little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love, when we are readie to broſt with fulneſſe, and ſatiety of conceit: ſin bites, but we feel it not: we can shift it off, and Chriſt came onlie to ſinful man: want preſſeth us not: need makes us not run.

            <p n="3">3. What ever then ſtraitens the heart towards God, and ſtops the cryes of the Spirit is a work of Satan; though the faireſt gift that ever we received: But alace! praying dayes are gone, the time was, when thou went mourning and praying in thy Spirit all the day; and in thy verie dreams, and now thy verie prayers are but dreams; and all thy ſtore is but windie emptineſſe.

               <hi>But my people would not hear my voice:</hi> Here is his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their ſecuritie and hardneſſe: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing chiefly herein, that they caſt off his Word, <hi>and would not hear;</hi> Nay, caſt him off, <hi>and would none of him:</hi> This is a fearful hardneſſe, that caſts off God and his Word and ſought other inventions. So that,</p>
            <p>When man caſts off the Word of Chriſt, all bleſſings and joyes is ſhut up from the Soul of man: and when he caſts off God from being his God: death &amp; deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt needs follow.</p>
            <p>So to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> and this is complained of by the <hi>Prophets</hi> more than all, Pſal. 50. <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Word into thy mouth: and haſt caſt my Word behind thee?</hi> And this was a fearful ſign alwayes, of the hardneſſe of the <hi>Jews: That they would none of Chriſt, nor his VVord, as</hi> Joh. 10. <hi>I told you, but you believed not: nor they would not receive his Teſtimonie:</hi> Nay, Joh. 1. <hi>The VVord of the Father was ſent a light into the VVorld, and to his own, but they received it not.</hi> And here <hi>Iſrael</hi> believed not his promiſe, that God would do thus to them: nor have God to be the ground of their reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For when man caſts off his Word, &amp; Chriſt: he is put to other shifts, &amp; ſeeks other inventions: &amp; walks in darkneſſe, and knows not whither he goes: Like an unfaithful Son, who dare not truſt the truth and love
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97089:49"/> of his Father that hath brought him up: but layes up a portion in ſecret, and gets friends abroad: and after a while, being thereby hardened caſts off the Father quite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the life of the ſoul is hid &amp; laid up in this Word, Pſ. 3.5 <hi>Our life is hid with God in Chriſt.</hi> Forſake this, &amp; forſake life: It is the treaſure of the Kingdom, all good is promiſed here: the Soul hath no certaintie nor foundation, but in this promiſe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For God hath ſent his Word &amp; Chriſt into the World to ſeek our the forlorn ſpirit of man, that is miſled by the flesh: and covered under the vail of the World; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Go ſeek &amp; find out that deſolat ſtranger. Thus he offers life, if it will return: But in ſteps the blind Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; Wit, and Fleſh of Man, ſecretly whiſpering: Now this is a blind way: Firſt, lay a good foundation: get the World, and ſomething to look at, then truſt: ſo alſo, be circumciſed and keep the Law, and then believe: Still the Soul a little enlightened by the truth, ſaith: But ſure this is not the way; me think, I hear, &amp; ſee fair way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and that is, Chriſt is only <hi>the way of Life:</hi> no faith the fleſh, Unleſſe we be circumciſed Chriſt cannot profit</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus in all unbelieving hearts, the Word of Chriſt is ſtill caſt off; for firſt, 1 It is foolishneſſe to it that a man should forſake the World, live by faith, follow God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he knows not whither, ſuffer the loſſe of my own Will; nay, of my Wit; nay, of my Life: and all this is a foolish way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it croſſeth the heart of man (which he will needs have) for rather than he will want that, he caſts off Chriſt himſelf with him, in Matth. 19. <hi>He went away ſorrowfull:</hi> So that mans infidelitie is ſtill nourished by fleshlie Reaſon, and fleshlie Luſts, which fight againſt Faith. 2. Thus the World truſts any thing, rather than God and his Word: For, 1. The World ſaith, Hearken unto me, and ſeek me, &amp; ply it, and be diligent, &amp; I will fill thee with fulneſſe? and thou shall not want.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So luſt calls, Come, I will fill thee with mirth, and put away ſadneſſe: delight thee with pleaſures: and yet the heart is ſorrowful.</p>

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:97089:50"/>3. So Reaſon, I will lead thee the good and ſafe way, behold thy Righteouſneſſe, Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What needs thou fear Theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Nay, ſaith Chriſt, Theſe will ſail: <hi>but come thou to me, and I will eaſe thee, and deliver thee, and redeem thee from all bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, We, that are traders in this Word, yet how is the heart slant from the ſimplicitie of the Goſpel, and ſo gets no good thereby</p>
            <p>For, 1 We gather concluſions from it by ſtrength of Witt and Art. We frame it to our conceits It begets ſtrong opinions in us: and we frame tricks, and ſelf-holie devices all out of it: which are but the Froth of our fleshly brains: But believing, not from a broken heart, tender &amp; relenting. We call opinion believing, and ſo as among men, it is too true a complaint. That plain dealing is gone: So in Religion, plain dealing is loſt. We profeſſe the Word, and trade in it, and caſt it off when we have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or we confound Law and Goſpel, becauſe neither hath power in us. We ſet one in the room of the other, and make the Goſpel effectual by the Law: and not the Law fulfilled by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or we make the Word ſubordinate to man, and not man to it, laying a foundation in our ſelves of good qualities, and building the promiſes thereon: when it is free without condition. We judge the Word, and are maſters of the Scriptures, and are not guided &amp; governed with it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or we ſeek a ſign or a wonder, that may confirm the word to us, that we might feel ſome joy &amp; peace: that we might know ſome aſſurance: But he ſaith, I have given thee a ſure Word, to believe that but in all, we caſt away God and his Word and hence it is we get ſo little good by it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But happy he that ſticks to this God &amp; Promiſe, it shall not fail, ſpeak the Word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole. What a mighty Faith, that believed, that Word, and was healed?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:97089:50"/>6. But this shall be a heavy VVord one day, when the Son ſtands condemned at the Bar, and the Father ſaith, Now thou ſeeſt, what is become of thy Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.

            <p>Thus to the old VVorld, <hi>I will no longer ſtrive with man.</hi> Rom. 1. <hi>He gave them up to vile affections,</hi> The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſuffered them to walk in their own VVayes and Counſels, Joh. 17. <hi>I pray not for the World:</hi> Theſe he leaves, if man have taſted the good VVord of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fall from that VVord, he is left impenitent. Thus the VVorld, when a man grows hardned, that the Father can do no good, then he caſts him off.</p>
            <p>Two things hardens above all. Firſt, Fulneſſe of the VVorld. Secondly, Knowledge of the VVord, without the power thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. VVhat may we then fear, when all our former working hearts, are turned into hardned knowledge &amp; preſumption. For Firſt, where is our weeping and mourning dayes? where is that melting and trembling of heart before the VVord? VVhere are thoſe cryes &amp; prayers after Chriſt and his Truth. Nay, all is turned into ſecure talking, or dead-hearted profeſſion: that now it is but a dead Letter. God is not with the Word, ſo that we may ſay as Deut. 5. <hi>I have heard all your

            <p n="2">2. But well-worth tender hearts, whoſe minds are drawn from the World, &amp; from all things of himſelf, what ever he feels, yea, though but death and ſorrow; yet joy and peace shall come, &amp; he will ſoon confound all enemies</p>

            <p>VVHen God intended to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, viz.</hi> Man out of the bondage of ſin and Satan, and bondage of corruption; He ſends <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to guide them according to his will; according to the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and now to be accomplished by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Firſt, He ſends him with aſſured confidence of his <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He hardens him againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; ceaſeth not to plague <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> till he make him yeild, though againſt his will, and ſo makes way for the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael, Iſrael,</hi> a figure of the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As they lived in <hi>Goshen,</hi> where was light and plenty, yet in bondage under <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> So we under the light of the Goſpel, yet bound in infidelity, and luſt of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, we ſtick not to the Covenant, or becauſe the time is not yet come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſtood faſt in him, yet for the preſent ſaw little hope of deliverance, ſo we though the promiſe be revealed in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97089:51"/> Chriſt, yet to our unbelieving hearts, little hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, But ſtill in bondage under Sin and Guilt, &amp; the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When they were paſt hope, after four hundred years bondage: God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver them, by an unlikely way; even nothing but the Word of God. So, when we ſee leaſt likely-hood in the flesh, God ſends a mighty VVord to deſtroy ſin, and to reſtore us to freedom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After he had laid manie judgements upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſtill leſſe hope for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> becauſe he hardened &amp; grew more raging.</p>
            <p>So with us, after the Word hath diſcovered man to himſelf, he ſees no hope, but burden, &amp; bondage doubled</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yet after they were brought out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet far from the Land of reſt, becauſe they walked not in the life of the Covenant, but after their own luſts; So we have much to be ſuffered, and our Will and the World to be crucified: But when he intended to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then he deſtroyed the firſt-born, even the ſtrenght of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in whom their name and power was to be continued, and ſo he dealeth with us, <hi>viz.</hi> When he intends to deliver the captive Soul of man out of the hand of Satan, he deſtroyes the firſt-born, <hi>viz.</hi> Our infidelitie, and all that power &amp; ſtrength which Satan reared up in man, and ſo brings <hi>Pharaoh</hi> low, So that,</p>
            <p>God never delivers his people, and brings them into reſt and libertie, till he hath firſt made them weak; and brought down their ſtrength, and laid them low in lamentation, and woe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.12. <hi>He brought down their hearts with heavineſſe.</hi> So with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,</hi> and with <hi>Paul;</hi> He ſtruck him blind to the earth, and took from him all his <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſtrength, as Phil. 3. Yea, <hi>Davids high mountain muſt be taken away, that he may ſeek to God and be delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For all that which is born of the flesh is flesh,</hi> &amp; muſt be deſtroyed, elſe, how can the Spirit live and be free; all that ſtrength we have, whether of confidence,

            <p n="2">2. Yea, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his hoſte muſt be drowned in the Sea, even in that hearty, ſorrow &amp; deep humilitie, that will drown all Pride, and ſelf-righteouſneſſe; or, what ever elſe lifts up man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus doth God bring man to truſt him, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void all other ſtrength to truſt to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For all divinity, power and ſtrength is affirmative, or poſitive in Chriſt: only negative in us: In denying, in forſaking, in crucifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that Chriſt may live, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſitivelie in us; which cannot be, till the chief of all our ſtrength be ſubdued.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But do we not with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſtill harden our hearts; and will not yeeld, though God ſend Famine, yet, we recover, and harden thereupon; Though Plague, we eſcape &amp; live: &amp; we depend thereon; We ſee and taſte ſore plagues: but the World, or ſomething creeps in and shuts us up in bondage and darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nay, though we feel ſmart, and want: Yet, we <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi> Satan, Mammon lives in us: and we cleave thereto: for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardneſſe is in us all in the Root.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Well were we, if our Firſt-born, even all our fleſhlie power and conceit thereof were ſlain, and that we were brought low enough in the fleſh, that <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the elect ſoul of man, might paſſe on towards reſt, according to the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the worſt of all is we feel no bondage; nay, we fear our firſt-born ſhould die: The World is no burden, but a pleaſure, Sin no ſorrow, but delight: We like ſo well in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that we dream not off, nor deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare not a departure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if God mean us good, he will kill the firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in us, and that by his only Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. There will come a deſtroying night to all men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Moſes called the Elders of Iſrael.</hi> Now before <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to depart: He ordains the <hi>Paſseover:</hi> that ſeing there should be ſuch a deſtruction, leſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould therefore doubt of the promiſe; he gives them a ſign or token of ſafetie, As Chriſt did, <hi>When the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd should be ſmitten, and deſolation ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. He preſcribes the manner, <hi>Take the blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He adds the promiſe, <hi>For when I ſee the Blood, I will pasſeover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſtablishing of this as a perpetual ordinance to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt, he layes down the matter of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the latter how to be celebrated: This ordinance was called the <hi>Pasſeover</hi> of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> the other was called the feaſt of the <hi>Pasſeover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was to be eaten in their private houſes the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth <hi>Niſan;</hi> the other was to be kept ſeven days, and was called the feaſt of the <hi>Pasſeover</hi> or <hi>unleavened bread:</hi> So that this is properly the <hi>Pasſeover,</hi> the other the <hi>Feaſt:</hi> This is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their deliverance that night: the other a Feaſt of rejoycing for that deliverance, Wherein their was a holy convocation the firſt, and laſt day, <hi>viz. A remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of the Lords mercie to them, and a teaching it to their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter of the Sacrifice was a <hi>Lamb</hi> of the firſt year, figuring Chriſt a <hi>Lamb</hi> without ſpot.</p>

The taking of the Blood and ſprinkling, it was a figure of his Death, So that all this, was but to lead <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Chriſt, and to wait on the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That though they ſhould hear a cry throughout all <hi>Egypt</hi> for the death that was among them.

               </gap>uld be preſerved So that,</p>
            <p>The whole Word of God, and all the Sacrifices given to the Church, are given to lead man from all things to Chriſt; and the ſtedfaſt ſticking to his Word and Promiſe, whereby they shall be preſerved in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, Iſa. 55. <hi>Behold, I have given him for a enſign,</hi> or <hi>witneſſe to the people.</hi> 1. Cor. <hi>He is our wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For ſuch is the diſtruſtful and unbelieving heart of man, that he hath given all things to draw him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, His Son in the flesh, and fleſhlie Sacrifices and ſignes, that man may ſee the accompliſhment of the Word before his face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the whole Word of God is nothing elſe, but a declaration of Gods purpoſe, touching his pleaſure, towards man and that Salvation which he determined in Chriſt; only declared to man, that he may believe: And therefore, hath given him the Word, Chriſt, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and manie wonderful miracles and great works on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all enemies, that they may wait on that Word, and ſtick thereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And thus Chriſt himſelf dealt with his Diſciples, ſaying; <hi>You are all ſory to hear that I muſt leave you, And believe not that I shall riſe from the dead: your heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For though I will judge the VVorld by my VVord, yet I will pasſeover you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my word, and in my Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. But, woe to the World, becauſe of unbelief: God hath promiſed, and that Word ſhall be performed in Chriſt to all believers. This he hath Sealed by manie ſigns, and yet we believe any thing rather: The VVorld promiſeth, and sheweth lying ſignes: and we believe: Satan promiſeth, and ſheweth lying wonders, and we believe: But God hath given his Son, and we believe not: <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the VVorld,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He hath given ſignes, and yet we believe not, he hath paſſed over others, and ſaved us from great dangers: and ſtill we believe any thing before him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, and of all things, men are leaſt led hither: any thing but Chriſt: VVe get knowledge by the VVord, and depend thereon, and proud thereof: it lifts us up, but brings us not down to ſeek hither. Nay, by this word we will needs comprehend God and his Power without Chriſt: <hi>when all power was given to him:</hi> Yea, of all other, the Righteous &amp; Religious man could not abide him, nor, walk in his ways, as <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſees:</hi> So we become righteous, and will live thereby: VVe run into a thouſand opinions, and devices, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but Chriſt deſpiſed of all. VVe provide Lambs and feed on them, but not on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And yet we ſee Gods way was alwayes a low way: He, a ſilly Lamb, and now ordinarie food of Bread &amp; VVine, that hereby, he might reveal the great Myſtery. They are poor and common, that he may croſſe Mans curious devices, and that the flesh may ſee no beauty in them, but in him onlie.</p>

            <p>It is not knowing, talking, or doing the thing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Word, and reſting thereon: Now, the uſe and manner of the Sacrifice lets us ſee the life thereof, <hi>the ſprinkling of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, though <hi>Iſrael</hi> was now full, and deſpiſed the honny Comb of Chriſts death; yet afterwards, were carried captive; they were forced to ſit by the waters of <hi>Babel</hi> weeping, and drink their own tears: as thoſe, Pſal. 37. <hi>Who had what they deſired, yet were they ſet in ſlippery places: and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly went down to hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This is too plain in experience, peace and plenty have been our portion many a day: We feed of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, &amp; baiſt our ſelves before the fire; we feel no ſmart, as do others; nor are we pinched with famine, nor hear we the fearful noiſe of the drum: nor are we affrighted with the terrors of an army. We dwell ſafe under our Vines, and are not driven from our habitation, as other our neighbours; who are glad to forſake houſe and harbour, lands and riches, to ſave their own lives. We play with our Wives and Children, and ſport our ſelves with them for company, when others hearts are broken with cries and lamentation of Wife and Infants: and knowes not how to ſave them from that approaching deſtruction that is coming: And yet, what effect hath this wrought: even like thoſe in <hi>Zephaniah</hi> 1.12. which ſay; <hi>Tush, God will neither do good nor evil; and tush, we shal feel no evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But look for it, for where this goes before, the other will follow after. If <hi>Sodom</hi> mock at <hi>Lot, through fulneſſe of bread,</hi> yet God will meet with them.

            <p n="3">3. To be croſſed then in the World, &amp; to ſuffer want reproach &amp; perſecution: is a ſafer way than proſperity. For, by the one man is driven to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But woe and alace to the poor World, who have not the World, and yet deſpiſe Chriſt moſt of any; For they are left to their own diſſolute Wills and Luſts, and want educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods Fear as much as meat: And therefore it were to be wiſhed, that the courſe begun might be continued.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But it is a fearful thing to make a mock of Chriſt, and ſet lightly by his Word, and to be ſo far in love with the World, that we eſteem not his Word: it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues we find little good therein, and little comfort by the Promiſe: For what we find any good in, we highly eſteem of: and what would pull us from our pleaſant pleaſures, we cannot endure: Therefore was the word of the Prophets ſo unwelcome to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo to us, For firſt,</p>

            <p n="2">2. The evil of Death preſſeth upon us, and threatens to make an end of all Joy, Pleaſure, &amp; Riches, &amp; leaves no Hope to man: thus we put off many dayes, &amp; think we shal yet live long, when men of our age are gone &amp; forgotten: but it haſteth upon us daily.</p>

            <p>So that, all theſe are but vain ſhifts and falshood: But the only way is with Chriſt, to take the evil day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. And for Death, no Covenant to be made with it: but ſeeing the vanity of the World, to meet it joyfully, and ſay, Thou canſt do me no hurt, but take the World and the Life which I eſteem not, and open a door to that life which I ſhal enjoy.</p>

            <p>Thus we all ſtrive to put evil far off, &amp; to ſhufle over the fearful dayes.

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, the <hi>Grammatical Conſtructions</hi> will not bear it: <hi>Credere,</hi> being taken to give credit, is put with a Dative Caſe, and an Accuſative Caſe: as in the <hi>Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe, there is no ſuch certainty in their Church for man to depend on; but that which muſt be the foundation of Faith, muſt be a thing certainly known and determined what it is: not the word but the thing. For ſaith is not verbal but real: But according to their own aſſertions, the Church is a thing to them not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known or determined what it is.</p>

            <p>And of theſe we agree not, which is the Church, on which we muſt depend. Some will have the Eſſential, as <hi>Tride. Catech</hi> &amp; <hi>Gloſſ.</hi> upon <hi>Gratians Decrees,</hi> which are Popes own law.</p>

            <p n="3">3. But the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of late, fearing this would prejudice the Popes Supremacy too much: concludes it is the Church Vertual, the Pope only or alone.</p>
            <p>And ſo while they boaſt of the Church: their Mother: they mean nothing elſe but the Pope, their Father. What foundation can there be here for man to reſt on?</p>
            <p>But we have a ſure word of the Prophets, and a ſure foundation, Jeſus Chriſt, than which none other ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How fearful is that deſtroying Angel, and Meſſenger of Death, or the Plague; when it comes to any place to them, that are round about it?

            <p>There is a day coming to man, that will turn all his riches and glory, and pleaſures, wherein he truſteth and rejoyceth into want, ſorrow and miſery, and death &amp; doom will ſooner or latter, lay all in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Where is now the glory and pleaſure of the Old World? or the Power of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Weal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. For there is a way that ſeems good to man, but the iſſues thereof, are the iſſues of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For God will take away from man all ſtayes in the flesh, that he may ſee and know, that there is no reſt but in him; for the life of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be loſt, that we may live by the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97089:60"/>3. Thus, God makes way for the manifeſtation of his mercy, and the delivering of Man out of Satans ſnare.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Woe to the deceived and bewitched heart of Man, whom Satan hath beguiled with the Luſtre of the world, and drawn from his God, who bleſſeth himſelf in his preſent portion and pleaſure, and thinks he shall ſee no evil, but enjoy many a merry day, but ſees not the black day when all ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>Nay, man thinks to joyn a perpetuity here, by joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning houſe to houſe, and laying a foundation in the earth, and then he ſaith, Is not this great <hi>Babel</hi> that I have built: And ſo shews his Wealth to the world, or at leaſt feeds on it himſelf, &amp; ſaith, Is not this a goodly portion, a loving wife, obedient and fine children, a good ſtock and portion, a certain eſtate, and never a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But know, though we may put off the evil day a while; and firſt, either bury it in forgetfulneſſe, or drink down fear like beaſts, or cover it with the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law? Yet God will either ſooner or later, ſtrip up our hearts, and either, firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Word, diſcover that miſery, that all our fulneſſe cannot remove, as before to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that with <hi>Job,</hi> we ſhal <hi>curſe the day of our birth, and with we had never been born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Or if he ſuffer us to run out the courſe of our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with the Prodigal; yet there will come a day, that will lay all in the duſt and darkneſſe: when we ſhal be caſt into the pit, and death comes, and will not be reſiſted: and then nothing but wailing and gnaſhing of teeth: Wailing for the Time of vanity miſpent, for Guilt of heart not to be eaſed, for darling with the World that was ſo eſteemed, and our friends ſo dear to part with: Then ſhal we ſee, that Wife and Children, Gold and Silver, that we ſee doted on, are but Droſſe: When the <hi>Babylonians</hi> have ranſaked our treaſure,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97089:61"/> as now to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and life taken away not to be reſtored.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are not the fair and admired beauties now defaced with rottenneſſe, and conſumed with worms: that were as ſmooth, ruddy neat, and trim, as thou art?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Are not the rich worldlings laid low in a poor sheet, and turned to duſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is not the wiſe-man dead as the fool, and all the counſels of his heart perished?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Are not drunkards and wicked deſtroyed: and their name and poſterity forgotten and rotten upon earth?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we ſee then, whatever man eſtabliſheth in his heart and fixeth his mind on, but Chriſt, muſt down, and nothing muſt be left: We all deſire to learn ſomething and to have ſomething to look at: we will truſt God, but we will have ſomething elſe to look at, ſome ſign and token; thus, man is lothe to part with all, but ſtill he reſervs ſome portion, ſome hope, ſome good quality, ſome righteouſneſſe to look at; no, there muſt be nothing left, but the <hi>Brazen Serpent:</hi> Nothing but Chriſt to look at, for all elſe muſt to <hi>Babylon.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Nay, we ſee how he takes away all excuſes, we think to eſtabliſh our poſterity, and gather for our children, that each may have ſo much, though we fear not our own portion: but even theſe shal be ſervants, we feed them with a coal ſtollen from the Altar: we leave them the fruits of our covetous hearts, and ſo brings them into the ſnare for an hours pleaſure, they alſo muſt into the land of darkneſſe: commit them to God with any portion; for if they may enjoy any ſmall pittance it is enough, for thou ſhalt not know whether they shall come to honour or low degree. Let all look for this in the day of fulneſſe, look for want &amp; miſery, for it will come; ſee thy ſelf taking leave with all thy Friends and Riches: for <hi>Pompey</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander</hi> are now conquered, that conquered all the World: Yea, the beſt muſt taſte of this; for Chriſts laſt day, was his heavie day, when Wrath &amp; Death lay upon Him. So that there is a more heavie day to be endured: only mans reſt in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97089:61"/> this day is, with <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> to cleave to the Word of the Lord in ſubjection.</p>
            <p>When the Prophet had delivered his meſſage, we ſee how <hi>Hezekiah</hi> takes it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He acknowledgeth the Power and Goodneſſe of the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſubmits himſelf thereto, in confidence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that according to the Word, Truth and Peace should be in his dayes; So that,</p>
            <p>The Word of the Lord is ever good to man, and his only treaſure on earth, and mans ſubjection thereto, his only freedom and reſt, Iſa. <hi>How ſweet upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are the feet of him that bringeth glad tydings of Peace.</hi> It is the joyful tydings of Salvation, the Word of Life, and the Meſſage of the Kingdom; and that wherein <hi>David</hi> found more joy than in all riches or great ſpoils: The Law is ſpiritual and good, the Goſpel is the meſſage of Mercy and Life; <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children:</hi> And <hi>Eli's</hi> ſubjection to the word of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> was his only hearts eaſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For though it fight againſt the World and Luſt of mans heart, yet it is for the freeing of Man from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For this Word muſt ſtand though it ſight againſt Man, and mans ſubjection muſt be his Reſt; For the Word cannot be changed nor fail.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For hereby is made known the Love of the Father, which wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. And our Subjection is, our preſent denying our ſelves, and partaking with Chriſt in his Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This carries the heart above all that he ſees or feels, though he ſee nothing but death; as here, yet hereby he knows that he shal be relieved, as a man having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murther, prays for pardon at the Kings hand: which being granted, how good is that word of the King to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet we ſee the carnal heart of Man ſees no good in this, delights in any frivolous ſtory more than this: believes any word rather than this, &amp; yet what footing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97089:62"/> hath mans heart in any thing but this: By this we shal be judged, and by this we shal be freed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet we are all found fighters againſt this, as in Chriſts time; the whole world oppoſed him: ſo when God by His Word, that the Worldings and Hypocrites ſhall not find reſt, they tush at it, and will <hi>Evah</hi> think, they shal have merry dayes, when he ſaith, All thy high looks muſt down, and thy great portion muſt be loſt: nay, ſaith man, But I will make them ſure, and ſo he truſts every thought of his heart, rather than his word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But know, the day will come, when this will be more worth, than all, and happy he that ſo eſteems it now. And for our ſubjection, every man hath a will and way of his own, which he labours to uphold: and rather deſires that his Word, rather than his own will might be altered: Yet, God ſaith, We muſt forſake Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and all: But man ſaith no.

            <p>None loves the Word or Gods will, but he that is prepared to bear the Croſſe: that man, ſeeing his own guilt and weakneſſe, may ſubmit in humility and look for mercy: then ſhall Peace be eſtablished in his heart, though war and trouble without: And truth shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ſoul, when all the World ſeems a lye to him: yea, though God ſeems his enemy, yet this truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a friend.</p>

            <p>THis Chapter and theſe Words contain the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpel &amp; the very ſum thereof: When <hi>Adam</hi> had miſerably fallen through rebellion, and become guilty of death: it was promiſed (though obſcurely) that a man ſhould riſe of the ſeed of the Woman, whom Satan had deceived, that ſhould overthrow his Kingdom, and deliver man
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97089:62"/> out of his hands: whereby <hi>Adam</hi> and the faithful was upheld until <hi>Noahs</hi> time; then the promiſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: and the Rain-bow given to teſtifie, that ſtill God would be good to man till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time. Then did God more clearly renew the ſame promiſe, <hi>In thy ſeed shall all Nations of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> From that time, the Prophets propheſied moſt clearly of this Saviour, and with ſtrong prayers and deſires, longed after this Chriſt; and ſo, from <hi>Abraham</hi> till <hi>David,</hi> it was more manifeſt both in the promiſe to him, <hi>Thou shalt ſleep with thy Fathers but I will ſet up thy ſeed after thee, and ſtablish his Kingdom: and I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son.</hi> Pſal. 132. <hi>God hath made a faithful oath to David, of the fruit of thy body shall I ſet upon thy ſeat.</hi> Pſal. 45. <hi>Thy throne, O God, endureth for ever, the ſcepter of thy Kingdom is a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Whereby he ſheweth, <hi>that a King shall ariſe out of the root of Jeſse, and the Government shall be upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Now, here is the <hi>Book of the Generation of this King and Chriſt ſo long foretold off,</hi> which shewes the wonderful conſent of the Scripture, So that,</p>
            <p>The whole Word of God declares nothing elſe, but the fall and daily falling: death and condemnation by <hi>Adam,</hi> and reſtoring by Chriſt; both which, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; become effectual to mans good and happineſſe. This <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 6. Gal. 1.</p>
            <p>The firſt is renewed again in the Law, and shewed in all the rebellions and wanderings of men, that ſo man may ſee himſelf, and be ashamed: and the other a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and incredible thing, that man curſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, should be reſtored by the birth of one man. Here needs faith, as much as to believe, that the Word was made of nothing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe are the two Principles of all Religion, that man ſee his dailie falling in <hi>Adam,</hi> and daily rebellion againſt God and his Word; daylie forſaking God, and ſetting up ſomething beſides Chriſt; which unleſſe it be ſeen, and believed, and felt; no Saviour to man. For Chriſt was promiſed to fallen man.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97089:63"/>2. This workes death in the heart, and in this death and dayly falling, is man directed to the <hi>Book of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> No believing of this wonder but in death, that mans meer want and miſery force him to believe this Saviour. For no reaſon can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a dead and curſed man, but the mighty word of God, which man may not argue how like or unlike it is: but that is the Truth of God for ever.</p>
            <p>But theſe are two Principles that are leaſt minded or believed. We frame a Religion of high thoughts, and make a trade of many devices: ſo that the ſimplicity of the Truth is hid by the witt and device of man. And herein, we trade for our praiſe and gain; But to believe the <hi>Book of the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this too law for their deep judgements. No, they have learned this long ſince, they have ſeen their miſery, but they are healed; they were wounded by the Word, but they have cured and covered it: So that now the Word cannot faſten on them. They are wiſe, and foreknow all things: and ſo able to awarde the blow. And for this book of <hi>the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they know it, and can comprehend it, and diſpute and prate of it, and have mangled and cut, added and diminished; but live not by it; and ſo full of opinion and windie conceits of all Truth, but believe it not, that this Chriſt is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man only, and now joyn other books to this; We dare not reſt on this without ſomething elſe to under-prope. Hence came in Circumciſion, Mans Righteouſneſſe, and Riches of the World through Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but to believe this Book, as to commit ſoul and life, and all to this promiſe, even when ſin and death bites; is the great power of God to believe Chriſt to be the Saviour of the World So that the whole Summe of Religion, is truly to know what man is, and what Chriſt is: truely to know ſin and righteouſneſſe: the one read in the Book of our own hearts, we need go no further: the other read in the <hi>Generation of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> When man utters forth but the frothe of his own ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving mind and thoughts, the fleſhly mind is tickled, but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97089:63"/> no certainty; but the book of Jeſus Chriſt is the Word of Truth, and aſſurance forever. O, that we had hearts prepared to embrace this myſtery. Here is the Fountain of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here is the Book of the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propheſied,</hi> now accomplished. Here note the Truth and Certainty of Gods Promiſe: So that,</p>
            <p>No certainty to mans heart in any thing, but in the living word of God, and the truth of the promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; this abides, all things elſe will fail, Pſal. 26. <hi>Thy mercy reacheth to the Heavens, and thy truth into the clouds. Abraham</hi> had no hold left but this, and <hi>David</hi> no comfort in affliction but this Word that ſuſtained him. We have a ſure word of the Prophets, which, though the Fathers in reaſon might deny, becauſe they ſaw nothing of Chriſts coming: yet they were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, till the day dawn: <hi>and then the Book of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt shall come, and his ſtar shall appear in the Eaſt:</hi> So though man feel not the comfort of this Chriſt, yet attending in that death, on the ſure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; the day ſtar shall ariſe in his heart. But man would feel and believe nothing, and ſo caſts off the Word, and flies to many inventions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For all things have their turns and changes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their uncertain natures and diſpoſition: and alter with fulneſs and emptineſs, with want &amp; riches, according to the Worlds uncertainty, but nothing can change or diſannul the promiſe: not the power of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> nor the malice of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> nor the treaſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> nor length of time, or alteration of Kingdoms; but at the fulneſſe of time, <hi>Chriſt muſt be born, ſuffer and die,</hi> &amp;c. So in man?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This gives certainty of the Fathers Will &amp; Love to wretched man, and he being ſtayed by this: endures the time of Tutors and Governours, of banishment &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: yea, of torment and wrath within: &amp; tyranny of Satan: yet waits in patience the revelation of the Goſpel. How powerful is the word of a King, that even by his word &amp; wrath hath ſtricken a man dead.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How vain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the heart of man, that ſeeks certainty
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97089:64"/> in every thing but this? Hath not Satan promiſed joy &amp; peace and loe, at death, all is gone, and man helpleſſe? Doth not the World promiſe certainty in its full por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſure poſſeſſion to thee and thine: And yet thou ſeeſt, or ſtill feareſt a decay in all: Doth not the Law promiſe life and peace, and yet when thou haſt done thy utmoſt, thou art ſtill guilty? Yea, doth not God make void the counſel of the flesh, and when man dies, all perish? and yet man will not learn nor read in this book, which is life. Now the word is certain in it ſelf? and ſo to man: when the truth thereof is believed, and written in his heart deeper, than all reaſon, or fleshly ſpeculations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as this book is the book of a Saviour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſo of death to unbelievers, that have caſt off this, and followed vain inventions: For both <hi>Moſes,</hi> in whom they truſt ſhall judge them; and Chriſt, in whom they truſted not, shall condemn them; for God shall judge all by his Goſpel. Then shall God ſay, I promiſed to <hi>Adam, Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they found life therein: I fore told by my Prophets: And in fulneſſe of time, I ſent my Son declared in the Book of this generations But him ye believed not, counted him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi> I would have performed all to the full; he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that came to me him by: but you were rich &amp; wiſe in the World, and truſted that you were rich and devote in your conceit, and deſpiſed him: Therefore, out of your own hearts, I judge you.</p>
            <p>Nay, without this: there is ſuch a certainty of death and curſe: that nothing in wealth or witt, no qualities or righteouſneſſe can wipe out: but it ſticks faſt in the bottom, till the Book of the Generation of Chriſt give certainty of Redemption by him.</p>
            <p>Happy he who ſticks to this foundation, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lifted up by high wiſdom, nor drawn down by baſe luſts: that judgeth not, but is judged by the Word of Chriſt. We read this ſtory: <hi>O, That we had hearts to read and delight in this Book or Word of Truth: We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this Chriſt, and we celebrate this Feaſt in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97089:64"/> thereof.</hi> But <hi>anone,</hi> every man runs to his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſoon weary of this, as though he either ſtood no need of this Book, or had it wrote in our hearts: We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and play, but it is not in this; nay, how little is this Book looked on: or minded or read in our houſes, or embraced in our hearts? When that beaſtly drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, liker liker Swine than Men; that unmanly cuſtome of Cards, ſitter for Childrens Bables, than to be the exerciſe of Wiſe and Reaſonable men: which the good Moral Heathens could not ſuffer their Schollers or Children, for making them too effeminate in their minds: and yet we fooliſhly make them our meat and drink, and let Chriſt ſtand behind the door. Well, this Book of the Generation of Chriſt will ſtand by man to his joy, when thoſe ſhall be all witneſſes, of vanity &amp; luſts of our hearts againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Son of David.</hi> Now he comes to his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>David</hi> is here firſt mentioned before <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe the promiſe was moſt in him, and Chriſt moſt uſually promiſed by the Name of the ſeed of <hi>David:</hi> And ſo he goes on from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Chriſt. In which Genealogy note, That moſt of the Men and Kings that are reckoned, and of whom Chriſt came: were wicked men and Idolaters, as appears in the Book of the <hi>Kings, Yet Chriſt was born of them, and the women mentioned all wicked and ſinners; ſave Ruth, who was a Gentile: and hated as a Dog of the Jewes; But Thamar, Rhab &amp; Bathſeba, all Adulterers.</hi> So that.</p>
            <p>The promiſe is made and ſo effectual, &amp; Chriſt born, and ſent by the Wiſdom and Will of the Father, only to; and for ſinful, loſt, wretched and condemned men: and none elſe.</p>

            <p>But know, all this is but joyning circumciſion with Chriſt, for which he thinks Chriſt ſhall become more effectual: as though he came to ſeek a Righteouſneſſe in man, and not to bring a righteouſneſſe to man: Nay, but as it was ſin by accident that brought Chriſt into the World at firſt: Yea, that he was counted the Maſter of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and one that brought falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo it the ſenſe of Sin ſtill, that brings him to the heart of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby is the hope of poor man preſerved: that Chriſt came of the ſinful Seed of men, and for ſinful man: if he had come only of the Faithful, and would have nothing to do with ſinners: then had we been loſt: <hi>But he is made a man like us,</hi> with whom we may talk as one with another: <hi>our Brother and friend</hi> Why then ſhould the fearful conſcience flie him, and make him a judge: who thinks, O! If I were a little more Holie, and leſſe Sinful, I could have hope: Nay, if thou were leſſe Righteous in thy conceit, and more ſenſibly ſinful, mercy were nearer.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So, that it is not properly ſin, that is the Rebellion of the heart againſt God, and in-diſpoſition to keep his Law, that hinders Chriſt; not becauſe thou art a ſinner in thy own eyes, but righteous in thy own ſight: Theſe are the enemies of Chriſt and of his Kingdom ever. So that the Goſpel of Chriſt never proſpers, but among ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, you ſee Chriſt was born of them: but man grows wiſe, and when ſin appears he fore-knows a Saviour, and ſo heals the wound before it be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham begat Iſaac:</hi> And ſo one in Chriſts Genealogie; where note, That as he was born of ſinful men, ſo there was a long tract of time after the Promiſe, before he came: even two and fortie Generations, therein allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the two and fortie Stations of <hi>Iſrael in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; where they pitched their Tents, and yet removed:</hi> and all this time alſo the Church had great trouble: Yea, none without: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſore tempted: <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo

            <p>Man ſhall endure many wearie dayes, and much trouble in the flesh, before Chriſt be truely and indeed born in him, or he live by, and with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſtations, they ſet down often and might not reſt there, but a new enemie aſſaults them: <hi>Davids</hi> eyes failed for waiting for the promiſe: O! When wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1.

For while Satan laid on ſtripes, he gave his ckeeks to the nippers, and let Satan ſtrike his full, &amp; ſhoot his laſt dart, whereby he had thought to have driven Chriſt from the father, or to have ſought help of the world; but he continued ſtill patient, and at laſt roſe &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over hell, and death. Nay <hi>Balaam</hi> could not prevail againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> by all his curſes, they ſtill being ſtayed on God; but by his wicked counſel perſwading to draw them to ſin, he wrought their death: As by his wylie drawing men to live by the world without God, that way he prevails much: now Chriſt delivers by his death.</p>

            <p n="1">1. But we ſeek deliverance another way, and think to eſcape death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One by his gaining the world, not loſing it: by ſaving his life, not by giving it up: to that end is wiſe, diligent, careful to put the evil away.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another by the firſt Covenant, and ſtablishing a righteouſneſſe of his own: but that hath nothing but death in it.</p>

            <p>Satan hath a large power and dominion over man to tempt and vex man with all calamities and loſſe of the deareſt object, yet cannot make void the Redemption of man to his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus with <hi>Job</hi> in all things, but his life, and yet by Faith and Patience he got the Victorie: when once he laid his hand on his mouth, and repented in duſt and ashes.

And he is called the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> and <hi>Satans,</hi> the accuſer of the brethren. Thus, Satan brings Death in all things, where the heart is not freed by Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="3">3. No way then, but living by the Word &amp; nothing elſe, he can deal with everie thing but Gods Word, &amp; unleſſe he can ſteal this out of the heart: he can thruſt nought elſe in.

            <p n="1">1. For man is guiltie before God; though by ſore-knowing

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97089:74"/> High Prieſt touched with our Infirmities.</hi> Like a loving brother, if his brother be overlaid, he pitieth his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and helps him: if he be beat, he ſtands by and cryes: if he want, he gives him half: Or as the husband helps his Wife, runs &amp; rides to do her good. <hi>For though he was the Word of the Father, yet he became a High Prieſt and fellow-feele, of our infirmities: he was given as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and witneſſe to the People, and the firſt begotten of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What then are thoſe high myſtical Speculations and Comprehenſions of Chriſt, making him ſo high: like ſpeculative Angels? This is but an airy Chriſt, but our Chriſt is low and among us, ſuffering, watching &amp; praying with us and for us. He comes not for theſe high thoughts, but for pure and contrite ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What a hearting is this in trouble to endure, when Chriſt, like a husband is preſent in well and in woe? We think our caſe miſerable: we bear the burden of ſin: lo, he was forſaken and ſick: he ſwate water and blood, he bears our weakneſſe: but who feel it? he pities our tears, but who ſheds them? he hears our cryes, but who makes them?</p>
            <p>So that all high thoughted Religion is not of Chriſt, but of the Devil He came to bring down high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Imaginations: We ſee then, that praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have a Friend at back: praying, when we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Friends may ſail, and Riches may vanish, and life taken away: but he endures yeſterday to day, and the ſame for ever. If then, we are weak &amp; miſerable, Chriſt is never wanting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thy Faith fail not.</hi> And then let him do his worſt, while thou ſticks to me, and goes with me through death and hell: So that,</p>
            <p>The only way of ſafety in all ſtraits: is a praying and believing heart: and while theſe continue: nothing can prevail, Pſalm 107. <hi>They cried in their diſtreſſe, and he heard them: we are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation</hi> 1 Pet. 6 8. <hi>When ſtedfaſt, reſiſt in the Faith.</hi> Pſalm. 9. <hi>They that know thy Name, truſt in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Theſe overcome the World, and crucifie the flesh, which only worke our bayne.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But our mouths are ſtopped, and hearts ſtraitned. We live by conceits only: we are full and pray not: Want makes man pray, and weakneſſe, him believe: And ſo Satan never overcomes: none but wiſe &amp; ſtrong men, theſe Chriſt rejects</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the time may come, when we shall cry, and not be heard: whatever ſtops ſtraitens and hinders prayer, is a ſnare: But O, Praying dayes are gone! But, Lord, increaſe Faith in all our hearts.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rethren.</hi> This is the monition that Chriſt left, and thou muſt go through much fear and have experience of ſorrows: yet faith ſhall overcome, though Infidelity ſeem to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: yet shall faith diſcover it, and then by renewing Repentance, Faith shall reſtore thee: So that note:</p>
            <p>That the faith and comfort of a man being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded, and covered; is renewed by daily Repentance, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Inceſtuous man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For as Chriſts Kingdom comes only to repenting hearts at the firſt: and as Sin in the World by accident, brought Chriſt into the World: So ſenſe of ſin in mans heart brings Chriſt thither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is way made in mans heart for mercy and joy in Chriſt, &amp; the heart driven to ſeek him in earneſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though man build hay and ſtuble on this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet God will deſtroy them by Fire &amp; the Croſſe, and bring back <hi>Iſrael</hi> with joy that went out weeping.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But herein it is, that our Faith is turned to a dead and fleſhly ſecurity, becauſe repenting dayes are gone; we did repent, and felt the bitterneſſe of ſin, but it is all removed, and joy and freedom is come, &amp; thou become ſecure: ſo that thus turns the eye from our ſelves, and Chriſt too: and ſo repentance is hid from our hearts. Is ſin leſſe odious to God than before, or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97089:75"/> doth he more tollerate it in thee than others? Art thou not more guilty, having felt his love, to turn from him: Is not thy Pride, and Self-Will and Love thy ſecurity, and high thoughts as odious to him: and as great rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in thee, as was the wanton ſins in the days of thy Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Haſt not thou as much need of his grace, and power to preſerve thee, as ever thou had to receive them? Shall we ſin, becauſe we are not under the Law, but under grace: Nay, as hard shall thou be ſifted: but I will bring thee back by deep Repentance, and thy Faith shall revive, though for the preſent it fail.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So that Faith is not preſerved, but by deep &amp; daily humilitie and repentance: As Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was partaker of great gifts, and more experience of Gods love and power, than thouſands, yet hereby was it preſerved: He ſtil rejoyced in infirmities, <hi>when he was weak, then he was ſtrong:</hi> Great Knowledge, devote Holineſſe, and high Thoughts, chooke Faith: only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie preſerveth it. The one lives by opinion, as light as wind; but the other by Faith and mercie, he feels no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weakneſſe and guilt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Well-worth weak and repenting hearts, that weep with <hi>Peter,</hi> We deny him often, but repent ſeldom: What ever knowledge, or other thing they have, yet if this be kept lively, Faith shall not fail: though it be ſeemingly loſt, and he turned his back, and he ſees no way to peace: Yet wait a while, and light will ſpring out of darkneſſe, and well-worth Croſſe that preſerves Repentance in man, when he ſees his own beaſtly guilt how he hath forſaken God, and run from him: and ſees how all fails: then he returns: So it is hard to preſerve Faith lively in proſperitie. It is a great point of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie to enjoy all gifts, and yet look at none: We ſee then, whereby man is preſerved in all ſtraits, <hi>viz</hi> a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing heart: all elſe vanish.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But praying dayes are gone. We have wept, but now rejoyce: We were weak, but now ſtrong in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strengthen thy Brethren:</hi> Pitie not me, nor weep for me: but weep for thy ſelf: <hi>and pitie thy Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:97089:75"/>
            <p>As the life of Faith is in Chriſt only, ſee the practice of Faith is in love to the Brethren, <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>My goodneſs is nothing unto thee, but to the Saints that are in the Earth.</hi> Thus all rules of practice after Faith, that are ſtabliſhed by <hi>Paul,</hi> are ſuch like as help the weak, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish the un-ruly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Chriſt left this his laſt Law, <hi>Love one another,</hi> and Faith works by love: This was Chriſts practice all his dayes in doing good, &amp; this is a free diſpoſition of a Redeemed Spirit, the fleſh ſeeks its own, but love doth not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus is the Fathers Love ſpread abroad, and the Truth of the Goſpel; and the Church increaſed, and herein is the Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But we all walk in the thearick knowledge of Faith and Chriſt, and nourish our thoughts therein; but we foreſake the practice of Faith: for ſelf-Love, and Pride hath drowned all hearty Religion. Do we help the poor, and relieve them? nay, we ſpoil them; do we bear with the Weak? nay, we judge them? do we cover the ſins of others? nay, we ſpread them: Do we love our Enemies? nay, We hate them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I wish we had leſſe Knowledge, ſo we had more Faith and Love. Is it not a shame to ſee how Drunkards are linkt together, and every Sect as one man; &amp; yet, we that profeſſe to believe in Chriſt, lead everie man to his own gain: So we thrive, we care not who loſſe; who grieves and bears the burden of others.</p>

               <hi>I will go with thee, though all forſake thee.</hi> Pride of heart, and over-weaning conceit of our own power, becauſe of ſome ſingular gift above others is the readie way to fall before all; ſo its in the <hi>Jews, Pharaoh, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, Lucifer:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>There is a preſumptuous and proud carleſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the arm of flesh: which goes under the name of Faith, and lifts man up in ſecuritie a while; but will fail in the end.

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the former Chapter, <hi>Daniel</hi> had interpreted the Kings Dream, concerning the Image of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Braſſe, Iron, and Clay, and the deſtruction of ſeveral Monarchies, by the Stone hewed out of the Mountain without hands; that is to ſay, The power of Chriſt, whoſe Kingdom ſhould overcome all the reſt, and be everlaſting, never to be deſtroyed: by which the King was convinced to acknowledge the great Power and Wiſdom of the God of <hi>Daniel:</hi> and ſell into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, but underſtood not the Myſterie of Chriſt therein, nor the downfal of his Kingdom, &amp; therefore preſently returns to his old Idolatrie; So that,</p>
            <p>The Word of God from God, and the great work of his power, doth for the preſent put man to ſilence, and convinceth him: yet, where the heart remains harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that the myſterie of Chriſt is hid from man, he ſoon returns to his old vanitie and Idolatrie of his own heart.</p>
            <p>Thus they are often convinced by the great Works of God, Pſal. 16. <hi>Yet forgot how they were brought out of Egypt, and walked not in the Covenant, but returned t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their Luſts:</hi> And the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Chriſts time often put to ſilence, but ſoon grew wiſe again to maintain there own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Yea, how manie of his followers, who ſaw his grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Workes, and confeſſed never man ſpake like him, or did the like; ſpake with ſuch power and aſſurance, and yet forſooke him: ſee the ſtony ground, and thoſe of <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For eaſe and peace, and proſperitie being offered, and a man lothe to live without them, <hi>they choak the VVord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Knowledge of the Goſpel without the power of Chriſt and his death, hardens above all; none ſuch enemies to the ſimplicitie thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:97089:76"/>3. For if the Truth and Power of God be revealed, yet if God keep not the Promiſe of Repentance by the Croſſe, &amp; ſo bring man under the power of that Word, he ſoon ſtarts up and becomes Wiſe, and Righteous in himſelf: not in Chriſt in the fleſh, not in Faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though for the preſent it daſh man, and convince him that he confeſſeth and ſweareth that it is the truth; yet when it both croſſeth his preſent eaſe and libertie, &amp; brings no life but death for the preſent: he grows wearie, unleſſe the great power and love of God purſue his Soul by his Word and Croſſe. Hence comes ſo much back-ſliding in the church, that men admire the great Power of God, yet not living in Repentance under the Croſſe. Every thing ſtarts up, and ſo, they turn to the old way, or a new device of their own; but do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the down-fal of their Kingdom for the preſent. For moſt men, when they have talked and ſhewed abroad their Wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, and increaſed their Glorie: they are the old men again: The World is welcome, and ſweet, Sin as light, themſelves at eaſe &amp; ſecure, as they had never known ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And yet they know their eaſe and ſecuritie ariſeth not out of ſimple confidence of Faith, but hardneſſe of heart: and clothed under a vail of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So it is a fearful thing to grow hardened after truth revealed; that man joyn hands with the World: &amp; that ſin become leſſe ſinful in conceit. This is a meer ſecuritie and not Faith: for if a man flie off, and that the Word ceaſe to judge man, arraigned at Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat: For Chriſt hath two judgements in mans heart, <hi>viz</hi> Judgement and Mercie: ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Man muſt give an account of what he hath done, Yea, of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dle Word:</hi> which is true in mans heart: for they are judged, and man tormented, untill he apply to mercie. For if he be not before one of theſe two, he is ſecure; may, this we ſee too common in all men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For though they muſt be brought at one time or other, to be judged in themſelves, and confeſſe that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But know, that this Word ſhall judge thee one day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we ſee, what a Fountain of Luſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is in all men, believers and others, how often hath God expounded our Dreams, reſtored our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, given Life in Death? and how ſoon are we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned either to the Worlds ſhifts in ſtraits, or forget the Lord, that brought us out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and feed our ſelves with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar made an Image of Gold, fifthy cubits high:</hi> He had forgotten the God of <hi>Daniel</hi> ſoon, and now makes an Idol, for his own glorie: &amp; preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even thus doth all; So that,</p>

            <p>He confeſſeth the <hi>God of Daniel,</hi> but hath an other Idol whom he worships. For doubt not, but all the Heathen had a general confuſed conceit of God: unto whom they then framed God a kind of relation in their conceit. For reaſon could tell them, that a creature could not ſave them: neither could <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> believe, that any creature could yet ſave or deliver him when he counted himſelf the moſt patient creature in the world: but had a conceit of God, unto whom he owed Worship: Some acknowledge the true Chriſt, but he is not the Saviour by whom they live, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: So that,</p>
            <p>Thus the World and the Church is full of Idolatrie, every man ſetting up the Idol of his own heart.</p>
            <p>One ſets up a Golden Image, as the King did here, and makes the World his great God. This he ſerves and truſts &amp; worſhips; yea, in all his laws &amp; threats, he fears the loſs of his labour: For if this God ſmile, he laughs; if he frown, he grieves; if he threaten, he fears; if he promiſe, he believes: and this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt God, moſt worſhipped in the World. The rich adores it, the poor prayes unto it, all bow unto it: But the great Idol in the Church, is mans knowledge and righteouſneſſe. This is that the falſe Apoſtles ſet up. This he decketh with Devotion, Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l and Charitie, but yet not much of that; he worships God before this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, he acknowledgeth Chriſt, yet with circumciſion joyned, this we make only God, we bow down as unto it: Nay, the Idols of mans imaginations are endleſſe. For the greateſt contemplators, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> Are the greateſt Idolaters, for they make an Idol of their own i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, or their ſpeculations: Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> was none of theſe, they lay in miſery, they believed God, they practiſed love, and went about doing good.</p>

               </gap>aſe of man in trouble and miſery.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Abraham,</hi> he believed that he was able to raiſe him up from the death, though he know not that he would; in that he ſubmitted to his will, Rom. 11. <hi>Concerning Iſrael, God is able to graft them in again,</hi> &amp; <hi>David,</hi> When he was driven by <hi>Abſolom, God can bring me again to the Citie and Tabernacle, if not, here I am: let him do what ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him good:</hi> So ſaith the <hi>Leper, If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean; and God can ſave by few as by many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he that comes to God muſt firſt, believe that God is, that is to ſay, there is Power, and Truth, &amp; Wiſdom in him; who, by his Power commands the Heavens, and they were made: who cauſeth light to shine in darkneſſe, Thus he argues in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah, Its I that meaſure the Sea in my hand.</hi> He that made the Heavens and the Earth, that doth lead through the Fire and Water, and brings down to Hell and Death. And this he hath promiſed, that he will not leave man in diſtreſſe, but all shall turn to good.</p>
            <p>So that, to denie all creatures and ſtrength of man, &amp; believe his power: to denie our ſelves, and be ſubject to his will is our only eaſe. For Chriſt ſo knew his Father was able to ſave him from that hour, yet was ſubject to his will, <hi>not my will, but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne be done.</hi> But Man hath a Will of his own, which God doth not alwayes anſwer according to his fleshly appearance, which man ſeeks to accompliſh by his own; or, becauſe man ſees not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a ſign or way of deliverance in himſelf, he fears and thinks all is loſt; when God in Wiſdom hides all from him, and takes away all ſtayes in the flesh, that he may deſpaire in himſelf, and truſt in another, and denie his will, that he may be made ſubject.</p>
            <p>Thus, we all denie the Power of God, &amp; think there can be no comfortable living in the World without fulneſſe of the World; nor that Wife and Children cannot live when we are gone, unleſſe we leave them full portions: but who fed <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Widdow of <hi>Sarepta?</hi> who fed the Ravens and clothed the Lillies?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97089:80"/> Nay, we do not ſee, that all the care and power of man cannot make him proſper, when Gods hand is againſt him: and do we not ſee how many he raiſeth out of the duſt, and ſetteth them with Princes: and yet this we truſt more than him: If we have friends and riches, we believe: if not, we fear, as though his power was limited to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Nay, thus in the way of Religion, we denie his power and will needs help God, as that he cannot ſave us without our help, Works, Wiſdom, &amp; Rigteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and theſe muſt be ſet up to look at, and we behold Chriſt through theſe, and Circumciſion: &amp; ſo we ſtand not as Beggers to receive of his fulneſſe, but as Traders in Religion, to bring ſomething unto him, as a thouſand Rams.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But what ſafety to the Citie, if God watch not, or what eaſe by riſing earlie, if God bleſſe not: ſo that none believes the power of God, but he that knows his own weakneſſe, and of all creatures: For ſtill God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his Power Wiſdom, and Mercie in the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Foolishneſſe, and Unworthineſſe of Man, and this believing Gods, Power, never more ſeen than in trouble; For while we are full, we believe, becauſe of our fulneſſe: but when all fails, then we denie him and limit him by, that we ſee, or feel; and hence, we denie him in our hearts: I shall never get out of this Miſerie; I cannot tell what courſe to take, I ſee no help, I have no friends: the enemies is full of Wrath and Power, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape his hand.</p>
            <p>Did he not put a Bridle in the Lips, and a Hook in the Noſe of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> ſlaying a thouſand and fifteen hundred in one night: Hath he not Promiſed to give thee a Mouth and Wiſdom, therefore thogh thou canſt not tell what to do, commit all to him, and ſee what he can do: As we do in any trouble, when we are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with ſtriving, we give our matters to another, to make what end he will, and we are content: So do with him, as <hi>Job, laying his hand on his mouth, and ſee what an End God made.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this nothing but ſubjection brings peace, for it is not our curious ſearching that finds it, We all loſt to know and ſee, rather than to be ſubject to his Will in patience, We would all know the time when, &amp; by what means, we would have it now and by Fire from Heaven. He hath promiſed and is able to ſupplie our wants, but we would know and feel it, and have it in abundance. Thus, Man would be a chief Lord in the Church, and leave nothing for Chriſt to do, he would have all things in his own hands, and yet for ought I know, when man hath moſt, he believes God the leaſt, and when he hath moſt confidence in himſelf he hath leaſt in God.</p>
            <p>But theſe argued not with God, nor tempted him, but caſt all upon him, he is able, and if he will, he can, and if not, his will be done. Thus man in ſtrength of his own will fights againſt God daily; we pray, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> but we never think of it: but rather that our wills might be accomplished, that His will might be the fulfilling of our luſts, rather than ſuffering want to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Him. We profeſſe that he will turn all to the good of His, we believe not truth, for elſe how comes this murmuring in want; but we think nothing can turn good, but that wherein we find preſent good: We would know and feel all, but believe and ſuffer nothing.</p>

               <hi>Be it known,</hi> However He do, yet we will not forſake Him; So that,</p>

            <p>The way of Faith doth moſt croſs the power &amp; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the world, of any thing; and therefore doth the World caſt it off, and grows furious and mad againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> preached Repentance, and they caſt him into priſon becauſe he told them, that their high mountains muſt be caſt down: and that in that way they could not be ſaved. Chriſt preached faith, to the convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, that they should believe, and they look at nothing but Him: <hi>And they hated the light, becauſe their deeds were evil:</hi> Therefore, were they mad againſt Him. <hi>Paul</hi> preached Salvation by Chriſt, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw circumciſion, and they ſtoned Him. And ſo the elder brother, the prodigal; <hi>Luther</hi> preached free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, without the righteouſneſſe of man, and the whole army of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was up in arms againſt him. So theſe ſtick to God, and the King is furious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For this leaves nothing for the heart to fix upon, but Chriſt, a thing unknown to fleſh and blood: If man would faſten on the world and reſt there, Chriſt ſhews it is a vain and a broken ſtaff, &amp; that a mans life ſtands not in that, for moths corrupt it; and as the rich man builded his barnes, this night will they fetch away thy ſoul: So that the worlding hates it in his heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If man will faſten on his righteouſneſſe, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, opinion, or any qualitie, Chriſts beats it down, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> makes it worſe than nothing; and leavs all under ſin: And ſo the wiſe and righteous men are alwayes the greateſt enemies to Chriſt: for they think much that all that which they have gotten with ſuch labor &amp; coſt ſhould ſerve for nothing: For man would have a life out of all things, but flees death in all things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay if man think to ſtore up joy and peace &amp; eaſe by believing, and ſo make his mountain ſtrong, by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97089:82"/> his revelations, gifts, and great joyes. Yet then Chriſt alſo comes with darkneſſe and ſufferings, and ſeems to forſake theſe men: and this makes the ſtonny ground to fall off: and theſe for a time rejoiced in his light, but forſakes him after: So that, Chriſt may well ſay, <hi>Who hath believed our report? for of all other things this is leaſt welcome to man:</hi> Nay, all hearts riſe againſt it, but he that is down already. The Worlding is tyed in his luſt, and worldly confidence, and his ears ſtopped, and his heart riſeth againſt it: for he would ſit at eaſe and enjoy his portion: So alſo the righteous and religious man, that excelleth others, and profeſſeth Chriſt; yet lives by circumciſion: He ſtorms and argues and diſputs againſt it, and gets ſtrong conceits and opinions to joyn the world, and eaſe, and Chriſt together, and none embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it, but the poor and miſerable heart.</p>

In ſuch ſecuritie was <hi>Iſrael</hi> fallen now, for which <hi>Baruch</hi> mourned, that they caſt off the words of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaying: It is falſe, and God would not caſt off his: And ſo follow the Idols and Imaginations of thelt wicked hearts.

            <p>This is a caſting off God, whoſe goodneſſe we have felt; ſo that now we live of our ſelves, to worke our own peace, procure life, prevent danger: for that is not now called to for counſel, nor is help called for as of old: and this is the hardneſſe wherein to we are all ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the time was, when the diſciples of Chriſt, and Apoſtles flocked in abundance and left all, as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Demas:</hi> but after a while they hardened &amp; fell to the World and eaſe thereof. The <hi>Galatians</hi> would have plucked out their eyes, but after turned enemies in legal righteouſneſſe, but we to dead ſecuritie, even thus with us: Time was, when the Word was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and prevailed to rule in us: but now we can abide it through wit and fore-knowledge, and ſleep quietly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But well worth tender hearts who eat and live by the Word, whether it ſpeak life or death: it prevailes above all; and hence ſee the greateſt provocation that ever was raiſed againſt God, whereby his own people had taſted of his love, and grown wanton in the flesh, and more fearful judgement fell upon them.</p>
            <p>So now, the ſilly ignorant wretch, when he hears but of any judgement, he trembles and bleſſeth himſelf after his own poor ſighing fashion: but the wiſe and great devote ones they mock him, and ſay, Tush, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we shall eſcape it, and call his word a lye: ſo that we may juſtly fear the ſequell of theſe fearful ſigns, theſe more certain ſigns, than in Sun and Moon: For where is the mourning, weeping, and repenting heart? Where is the lowly, believing mind, that joyes in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation? Where is the open, loving, ſingle heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect.</p>
            <p>Well, nay, we cry, Woe is me now, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath caſt off the Lord, and we fight againſt his Word: our long peace hath made us ſecure. The Word &amp; Works

               <hi>God hath added grief to my ſorrow.</hi> New grief to my old ſorrow, one grief after another, that I find no reſt: though I faint in my ſighing, ſee Gods dealing: So that,</p>
            <p>God uſually tryes his to the bottom, and adds one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to another, to all which he loves, and ſuffers them not to find any eaſe and reſt in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>As with <hi>Job,</hi> Pſal. 78. <hi>He brought down their hearts with ſorrows,</hi> Pſal. 77. <hi>He wept all night.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> had fightings and terrors: thus Chriſt, and the Martyrs even perſecuted unto ſtrange Cities: thus <hi>Abraham</hi> nothing left, Pſal. 4. <hi>One deep calls another;</hi> thus the wayes of Chriſt, and our conformitie to his death; For untill man be throughly whipt, and beat under, he runs to ſome new shift.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And ſo God in love chaſeth him from all holes, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he was brought from his Countrey, yet he had no Children, then was <hi>Iſaac</hi> given; then he had hope in the flesh, but he took that away.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus was Gods dealing with the Church, though they had ſome breathings given: yet, when the flesh b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Man will lay hold upon any thing before he drown, yea, even a Leaſe, or Reed, but God plungeth him into the deep, and then he cryes, and is heard.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Light afflictions makes man more wiſe and wilily to eſcape in the flesh; but ſound and deep grief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſorrow brings down the heart, and makes h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We add joy to mirth, the Pipe and Tabret is in out Feaſts, we drink and care, and laugh in the midſt of our finning, but Sorrow and Repentance is hid from us: We have not reſiſted unto blood, nor affliction hath taken us, but ſuch as with a little time of Wiſdom could remove, or at leaſt forget.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But know, if God intend thee good, he will add grief to thy ſorrow: Thou thinks it a heavie thing, to loſe Father, Husband, or Wife; but it will be a heavier thing to feel the burden of thy Spirit, when God hath turned his Face away, and taken all from thee: that thou fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Thus the Faith of our Church is all fleshly; fleſhly joy, proſperitie, caſt, the Spouſe of Chriſt, Canticles 1. <hi>Is black: and her Locks w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. We ſee alſo the ſpringing corruption of man, like the ſpringing Willow, by the water ſide; cut it now, and it shoots out the next ſpring.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So that believers needs abundance of purging through affliction: For ſtill we retain ſomething, and gathers ſome hope from thence, and ſo flesh ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news again.</p>
            <p>This was it I think, which led ſome honeſt minds to betake themſelves to ſuch auſtere living: thinking thereby to tame the flesh; &amp; voluntarily denying fleshly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97089:85"/> caſe, but yet it ſprung up under a more ſpiritual form: but in a greater miſtery of wickedneſſe: For, look how far a man afflicts himſelf he is able to comfort himſelf: but if God add grief to thy ſorrow, and lay it on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it will fetch tears, yea, blood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The way of man never ſorrows till it be kindly, ſuch as all flesh cannot eaſe: it was ſo with thee once, and why not now? It is but a light and fleshly ſorrow for want of eaſe, that is eaſed by any thing in man: but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? but we take wounded flesh for ſpirit: For that is, when a ſpirit is wounded with guilt and want, becauſe it hath followed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the flesh, and then as here is no way ſeen for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie, but ſighing and fainting therein, till God beyond hope, come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will pull down that which I have builded.</hi> He will caſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> away, whom He once chooſe for his only people: <hi>I will ſend them into Babylon,</hi> whom He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to dwell in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to worship in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and all becauſe their hearts were lifted againſt him in their imaginations: So that now he will pluck up all, that he may caſt down their vain confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were hardened in ſecuritie, and lifted up in pride: So that.</p>
            <p>God will certainly deſtroy and caſt out the faireſt gift given to man, when mans heart is lifted up thereby, and hardened therein.</p>
            <p>Thus he pulled down the confidence <hi>Iſrael</hi> had in the Ark: Thus he brings down <hi>Davids</hi> high mountain, and <hi>Pauls</hi> rebellions: this was <hi>Johns</hi> office to deſtroy high mountains: <hi>Paul</hi> had confidence in the flesh, but G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d laid it in the duſt: So that after he confeſt, <hi>That in me dwells no good thing,</hi> but is given only by Chriſt, in ſuch humility and baſeneſs, that man might not be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, his kingdom not be here: He arrogated nothing to Himſelf, but to his father, <hi>Not mine, but him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For Chriſt will pull down all other kingdoms, that he may erect his own, as in <hi>Daniel:</hi> the kingdoms va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97089:85"/> one after another. This is the ſtone hevven out of the rock without hands, and therefore Chriſt came to deſtroy the kingdom that the law had builded in man, and to convince the world of ſin, becauſe of righteouſneſſe which they had eſtablished: of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Prince of this World judged falſly of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For man is cloathed in his gifts, as the Angels: &amp; became ſtrong and wiſe without God: He hath built him a city, provided a portion, working righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, full of knowledge, a God in his own eyes: but God will pull all theſe dovvn that he may be God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The vveapons of our vvarfare are mighty through Him to pull dovvn ſtrong holds, not through our ſelves: And this he doth by the povver of the vvord, It is a mighty voice, and thereby layes low all mans thoughts for the preſent, and by the Croſſe kindly together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All gifts that God gives to man are to shew his power and love, for the good of others: not to make them the Idols of our ovvn hearts, and ſay, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods; O Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Woe then to the Pride of man, vvho is lifted up by every gift: exalts himſelf, judgeth others, deſpiſeth the weak; but ſuch boaſting muſt down: yea, whatever God gives them, he will take it again if you begin to ſtore it up.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great point of ſimplicitie of heart, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all gifts the hearts be lovv, &amp; lifted up by none: vvhen he hath ſeen all ſecure, he ſeeth none: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth freedom, yet vvalks in fear: as the Child, though he vvant nothing, yet he hath nothing properly his ovvn: God is and will be the keeper of his ovvn gifts, vvhich vve put into the hands of flesh: O! therefore, lay your foundation on a Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But know there vvill come a pulling dovvn, as to <hi>Iſrael, when they ſate by the Rivers of Babylon:</hi> What fooliſhneſſe, vvhen it is us that builds and plaints, and gathers and makes ſure that vvhich muſt be caſt dovvn
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97089:86"/> and ſcattered? when thy mouth shall be filled with gravel, thy portion ſcattered, thy honour buried in duſt: thy ſtrong confidence perisheth, thy Soul carried into the land of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. See the perverſe heart of Man, and ſtrength of fleshly heart, Who the more God beſtows on him, the leſſe he cares for him: like an untoward, Child keep him bare in Faith and dependence of his Fathers love, and he prayes, and believes, and is obedient: but fill his hand, and let him have his Luſt, he ſets his Father and Mother at nought: Yea, thus the Flesh makes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the moſt excellent gifts: as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re, even the joy, peace, and aſſurance God gives man: for man retains nothing, but is lifted up by it.</p>
            <p>And believes that it is God, but not man more humble and low to ſee his own vileneſſe, ſaying, <hi>What is man, that thou regardeſt him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doeſt thou ſeek great things for thy ſelf, ſeek them not.</hi> Thou mourns &amp; weeps, that this deſolation muſt come It is becauſe thou finds eaſe and peace, and great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: no, all shall be taken away: Seek them not, for this is the cauſe why thou art ſo troubled, thy fleshlie luſting, not throughly mortified and prepared in faith and patience to wait: So that,</p>
            <p>The main ground of all our miſerie and ſorrow is, our laſting expectation of great eaſe and peace in the flesh, not faithfullie prepared to be ſubject to Gods will, or content with his preſent portion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> looks that <hi>Abſolom</hi> should be ſpared above all and therefore was ſo grieved at his death: yea, more than at the death of all the reſt. <hi>Peter</hi> expected to have his life: &amp; continue there in peace: therefore ſo wiſhing, that Chriſt should not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> had overcome <hi>Senacharib:</hi> he thought he should live in peace, which made the meſſage of death ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Luk. 12. <hi>He ſaid, Soul, thou haſt goods laid up for many years: Take thine caſe, eat, drink, and be merry: therefore death was that night ſo fearful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus we ſee in experience, and ſay: I was finelie
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97089:86"/> ſet, I had paid my debt, gotten a good portion; built an houſe, provided for wiſe and children in a good way of thriving, and verie like to have riſen: and now all is gone. For look how far the heart is lifted up in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo far it is caſt down in the want of any thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Luſt leads out the mind beyond preſent ſtate, and ſets a ſeeking great things, not content with preſent: &amp; ſo both wanders in deſires and uncertain hopes: &amp; when they have gotten them with much toil, they are left in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>nd what he hath, becauſe of the want and expectation of what he would have. But ſubjection is neceſſarie in all eſtates, thus we are carried ſtill in expectation of great matters, that we forget the preſent one, of great riches, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inheritance for himſelf and his; and it may be; he or they dies a beggar.</p>
            <p>Another of great joy and comfort, and good will: keeps low his heart in ſorrow. All expects a mending of their condition, which till it come, they pine and languish: The way of reſt is to walk faithfullie for the preſent, and reſerve the iſſue unto God.</p>

Hence we ſee, how hard it is for man to continue in any good way: with God is continuance, man failes oft, for man is lothe to ly in the duſt ſtill, and to ſuffer affliction, and mourn, but he will have ſome merry dayes: and if God give it not, he flies to the world, and ſeeks it there: And yet we know that man never finds life but in death, and <hi>Paul</hi> never rejoiced ſo much as in infirmities: which argues, we are abundance of fleſh, but little ſpirit; for one hour that we live in the miſery of our own ſpirits, we live then in pleaſure or hopes of the fleſh.</p>

            <p>Where the Grace and Love of God by Faith, is not continued to man, there Faith and all Religion fades, &amp; where Religion fades, there all joy and peace and happineſſe is loſt, and comes to nothing: as Heb. 6 <hi>They taſted of the good Word of God, but yet fell away in the end:</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus</hi> &amp; <hi>Phletus,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Jude:</hi> &amp; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> &amp; <hi>Laodicea, Revel.</hi> 2.3.</p>

            <p n="2">2. When this fades, man daparts from God, as

            <p n="3">3. All things have a paſſage through man, and he gets a taſte of good in them, but they fade in time: only Gods love and mercy endures for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When man returns into himſelf or the World, he ſoon grows weary; as the leaf, when the ſap is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the root in the earth; ſo we, when the ſap of God is deſcended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence it is, that ſo much fair ſhining Religion comes to nought in the end, being but the work of man, it fades and dies in man; but that of God abides for ever. Thus have we ſeen much Religion dye; What zeal and ſorrow of heart? What love &amp; affection to the truth it ſelf? and now all is drowned up with a fleſhly ſpeculation of theſe things, but the life is gone.</p>

Shewing the conſtant dealing of God in his Church, calling in by the Word of Truth ſuch as have been aliens and enemies thereto, &amp; caſting off ſuch as have enjoyed it: yet walks ſtubbornly in pride after their own wayes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> were a people particularly choſen to God by a ſpecial Covenant, and preſerved by his power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe: But the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were Heathen aliens and Idolaters, who walked every one after his own way; that had nothing to do with the Covenant and ſpecial bleſſing: Not that they were reſtrained from enjoying happineſſe, but that none ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that cleaveth to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and became a <hi>Jew.</hi> Theſe were turned from their own wayes to Gods, others fell from God to their own; for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Word and way before them, yet did cleave to their own wits and wills, and thereby would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his righteouſneſſe.

            <p>How unlike, that <hi>Abraham</hi> an Idolater ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Father of the faithful? For he ſought nor nor enquired after him, yet God called and he obeyed: And <hi>Paul,</hi> the great enemy of Chriſt, yet was made the great Champion of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>But I may ſay, Have they not heard? Yes, the ſound is gone through the World, ſo with thee: Hath he not ſought thee, and called thee daily, and yet thou hardens thy heart againſt him? Thou haſt not ſought him, but he thee: and yet thou hideſt thy ſelf from him all thou canſt.</p>
            <p>Thus doth every believing heart that knows himſelf, find in experience the wonderful power and mercy in Chriſt, when thou waſt wallowing in thy gored blood? yea, following the ſway of thine own will: yea, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy heart with fleshly pleaſures; then God knocketh at thy heart, when thou little thinks of him: nay, ever ſince, when thou felt nothing but guilt and death, &amp; ſaw no other reaſon, yet then he gave life.</p>
            <p>Nay, when thou had in ſtrength of wiſdom, not from a troubled heart: thought to eſtablish thy thought of happineſſe: yet he beat thee down. Yea, when thou thought thy ſelf in the likelieſt way to become happie, then proved it moſt curſed: &amp; when thou ſeems moſt wretched, it becomes ever beſt from him: And all this God hath done, that thou mighteſt for ever believe him, who hath choſen and called thee one: thou knowes moſt vile, rebel, luſtful, covetous, unlikelieſt of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
            <p>This confounds all the reaſonable wayes of fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which man hath framed to himſelf, either out of the world, or out of Religion to eſtablish his thoughts of eaſe and happineſſe: for we ſee the offers of grace and his great works, and then reaſons <hi>à poſteriore:</hi> and thinks to aſcend thence to happineſſe. But his grace is free out of our compaſſe, &amp; it is to be attended on.</p>
            <p>We would know a reaſon of God in all his works elſe we hold him not juſt. But what reaſon is it tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So man is buſie in ſeeking and working to make himſelf rich, ſearching &amp; knowing to become wiſe &amp; glorious; Nay, man labours to mortifie the fleſh, to get life thereby: but mortification to dayly dying is life, but to get life thereby is death: for where man kills the flesh, to quicken Life, he loſeth both: for all mortification ſo much urged by Chriſt &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> is only that care &amp; diligence, according to that Wiſdom given to us: that thereby the flesh and daily luſt may be kept under, that the heart harden not by fleshlie eaſe, &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo grow wanton; but not to give Life to the Soul, and ſo are all wayes of mortification.</p>
            <p>It is good to reſtrain appetite, to keep out the World, to walk temperatlie, and ſoberlie, and diligentlie in our calling: Theſe are good and honeſt wayes to be choſen, to keep under the rebellious Fleſh: But to do theſe with an opinion of Life thereby, is moſt baſe and double dealing: for while we pretend to be humble, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>There is in all men a Rebellious Will and Luſt: yea, even in believers, which it ever leads man from God into miſery, and bondage, as in <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> complains of it, Rom. 7. Gal. 5. <hi>This fights againſt the Spirit,</hi> though the will and deſire of man be natural qualities, yet when they are ſet upon vain objects, and come to rule and draw, they ever bring into bondage.</p>
            <p>For, hereby is God more denied than by any: for though they know him to be true, they truſt him not: and as for a ſtranger to denie and diſtruſt a man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but for a Child it is Rebellion, and Rebellion is as the ſin of Witch-craft, it denyes God, and makes a Covenant with the Devil, and workes through envie ever to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus, unblief ever Rebells againſt God: yea, raiſeth up arms againſt him: When he would be a King, no ſay they, This man ſhal not rule over us; but would reign as King themſelves.</p>
            <p>But believers moſt of all, who dwell in the Kings Houſe, and profeſſe alledgeance and ſervice, and yet underneath, practiſe and labour that they may be King, and wear the Crown: and ſo are ſtill drawn from God by Luſt and fleshlie Wiſdom: And this may he ſay to our Land, he hath ſtretched out his hand long over us, but we ſtill Rebel: witneſſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That common trade of iniquitie, as common as breathing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hardneſſe of heart under the Vail of the Goſpel</p>
            <p n="3">3. That heartleſſe dealing betwixt Religion and the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That caſting off the Word we profeſſe, &amp; believe not that to be true which we know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This makes man an enemie to God, &amp; this is it which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97089:95"/> makes thee caſt the Son out of doors; we walk in a way that is not good, after our own thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So the Lord may ſay: They have forſaken my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> They follow their own, which leads into an ill way of Life. So that,</p>
            <p>When man forſakes the ſimple Word of God, and cleaves to the devices and inventions of his own thoughts, and follows them: he forſakes the way of Life, &amp; chuſeth the way of Death which never proſper.</p>
            <p>It was the Curſe that lay on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> That he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered everie one to walk in his own way, as Pſal. 18. <hi>They would not hear, nor would have none of me, I gave them up to their own Counſells:</hi> Thus <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the way of the Covenant and Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, and made a Calf, and murmured againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> &amp;c. The wicked walk in a way that is not good, <hi>There is a way that ſeems good, but the Iſſues thereof are the Iſſues of Death.</hi> For though man was made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet he ſeeks manie inventions, to ſave him: but not by the way of righteouſneſſe: He hath ſold the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and Covenant, he hath forſaken with <hi>Eſau:</hi> and now he would have the bleſſing by any means: He mourns &amp; weeps for the bleſſing, &amp; would have it though by killing his broth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, &amp; living in an hunting way.</p>
            <p>For mans way in himſelf is not able to guide him to happineſſe, for luſt blinds him, and leads him to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſenſual: reaſon is proud, and leads into all things viſible, but Faith is the ground of things neither ſeen nor felt.</p>
            <p>But Chriſts way which was the way of Life, was not after his own thoughts, but as the Father commands, ſo he ſpeaks. He ſought not his own glorie, but did the Will of the Father, ſtablishing his Kingdom, &amp; ſo his way was a new and living way, though the Vail of the flesh was rent: And ſo it is with man, not by a way of the Flesh; but to break through the Flesh, &amp; by crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, enter into the Holieſt of all by Faith onlie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This was the way preſcribed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97089:95"/> brought them out by a ſtrong hand, and weak means: as alwayes in the whole courſe, that no power of the Flesh might appear, as <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth, they got not the land by their own power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then in the Wilderneſſe, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they took no reſt, but in the Covenant only.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then through Jordan, the River of Tears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then overcame the enemie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God left them a Law of love to walk by.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Commands not to joyn with the enemies, but to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>But all theſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook, &amp; at the laſt grew ſo preſumptuous in regard of their proſperitie: and ſo wiſe in Religion, that they would not be beholden to God, but would ſave and free themſelves by wayes of their own, till at laſt they fell from God: and ſtill they thought this was a holy and likely way: Thus the old courſe of the World is fallen upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> everie man walks in his own way, and yet everie man thinks his way is good, and like to proſper: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Worlding, by getting, and gathering and making ſure for future time: ſeems a ſafe way: but Chriſts way was to forſake all the World, and had none of theſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Wanton thinks his way right, becauſe of his ſaint way of Repentance, and yet he fears, Eccleſiaſtes, <hi>That it will lead to a fearful end of judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and falſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> walk in a ſeeming way of holineſſe with Chriſt: but this makes Chriſt &amp; all in vain, to joyn any thing with him: For Chriſt was to denie himſelf, and cleave to the Promiſe of Faith, yea, though he was to be taken from them, yet they ſhould wait for the Promiſe of the Father: who ſhould ſend the Promiſe of the Father within few dayes.</p>
            <p>Nay, we are grown ſo cunning in Religion that we can chuſe our Chriſts own Way, and approve it, but walk not therein by the Spirit of Chriſt: but ſo follow Chriſt in our fleſhly thoughts, but not by Faith alone, giving up our ſelves in love to the good of others.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:97089:96"/>
            <p>So, we ſee Gods wayes is not our wayes, yea, &amp; our though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s and his words never agree together: one of theſe muſt be forſaken: either we muſt cleave to his Word, and forſake our own wayes, or follow our own wayes, and forſake his Word.</p>
            <p>But we live by thinking not by believing: Invent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and comprehend, that we may guide our ſelves: but not reſt in patience to believe another: Like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal: but ſee the good and ſafe way of Chriſts; that ſtands in ſimple believing from a troubled heart, and in ſubjection to the Fathers will in love, in patience to bear his Croſſe. But this is grievous to fleshly thoughts but ſweet and ſafe to the Soul.</p>

            <p>For now they ſin with an authoritie, under the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of a Saviour: Like a man in the Kings houſe, that robbeth and oppreſſeth under the hope of Pardon.</p>

               </gap>tſoever makes man ſtrong hearted, is not Chriſt, for he melts the heart in ſorrow and in love: For this is the greateſt diſgrace that can be; if a man muſt bring Chriſt to help forward his Luſt, As to ſteal and oppreſſe, and Chriſt muſt help us. Thus with us.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:97089:96"/>
            <p>God hath holden out his hand, but we dare provoke him to his face, and call his Word a lye, &amp; run to other shifts; as though we ſeem to flatter a while, yet Religion is but made a way to bring about our own Luſts, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do get the World more freelie: or advance our glorie, or keep peace: but all theſe covers a Rebellious heart: For if it were ſeen as thy Face, thou wert a shamed for ever. This is the greateſt Rebellion in the Church, covered under Religion, &amp; God moſt provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby: For here man tempts God, and layes all blame on him, blindly waiting for his Power: yet hath no heart nor deſire to return, ſtoring himſelf with Riches and Righteouſneſſe, that he may not repent.</p>
            <p>But do we provoke him to anger, or rather our ſelves to our own confuſion? for we ſee how he delt with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> led them captive, &amp; then caſt them off: Doubtleſſe he was never more provoked, they ſacrifice in Gardens, and burn Incenſe on Altars of Brick, which should have been on Altars of Stone, without a hammer.</p>
            <p>Thus he shews how they chuſe their own wayes, that is to ſay, They ſacrifice in Gardens when the Law was at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> burnt Incenſe on Brick, which should have been on Altars of Stone without a hammer; as Chriſt the Stone hewen out of the Rock without hands: they lay among the groves there to enquire of the dead for the want of things, and not waiting on God, and the Words of the Prophets, <hi>They eat abominable broth, and ſwines Flesh,</hi> both which were forbidden by the Law</p>
            <p>So that in all, they forſake Chriſt ſignified by all thoſe and chuſe their own wayes: and this is mans way in the Church: We offer not at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſitting at the door of the Tabernacle, weeping and confeſſing. Where is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Mercie Seat, and Ark of the Covenant: but in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of Pleaſure, in ſerving God at our leaſure, and not on the Corner-ſtone, Chriſt Jeſus, but on the Altar of our good qualities, which we have hewen to our ſelves? We wait not on God, &amp; his Will &amp; Word, that we may know it: but in the dead groves of our devotions, and run back to theſe rotten effects of care &amp; diligence.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:97089:97"/>
            <p>If the World ſhew good ſigns, we believe: if we ſee ſigns and Wonders, we truſt; we feed on Swines Fleſh, Flesh and broth thereof: That is, we feed on the Fleſh and filthy World, which begets nothing, but flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and cold opinions inſtead of pure nouriſhment to Faith and Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stand by, for I am holier than thou:</hi> So with all theſe abominations, there went ſtill a poyſoned opinion of holineſſe and high thoughts, which made all ſtink in his noſtrils. So that when with Religion there goes a high thought in man, and exalting of himſelf above others becauſe of his Religion: it poyſons all and ſtinks before God, and will bring man to a fearful fall at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> I am not as other man; as this <hi>Publicane,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not.</hi> It was their practice when they had been at the Mercat, they washed: &amp; the falſe Apoſtles thought themſelves more acceptable to Chriſt, becauſe they were circumciſed: And thoſe Gadders in the Church that went about talking, and thought becauſe of their Religion, they ſhould be reſpected and relieved, which <hi>Paul</hi> writes againſt, that they should not be ſuffered. Thus is Religion turned into mans own glory and not to Chriſts glory.</p>
            <p>This flows from pride and ſelf-love, which had its beginning in man, &amp; ending in man, as all things do. This makes men Judges in Religion, and not Chriſt a Saviour: and ſo with all Religion, there grows up a curſed opinion and ſeeking of reſpect, which poyſons all. But well worth that Religion where man is not liſted up by it, and hath nothing, but all laid up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in Chriſt, not in ſelf.</p>

            <p>IN the tenth verſe of the former Chapter is a large promiſe of Mans Redemption by Chriſt, under the Type of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance out of captivity: as, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way of the Lord, caſt up the high-way, gather up the ſtones, lift up the Standard:</hi> The Lord hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the end of the World, to <hi>Sion:</hi> Behold thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cometh, his reward is with him, and his work before him: That is to ſay, Make readie the hearts of men by repentance, and then ſalvation is at hand, and thou shalt be a holy people prepared of the Lord: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way, that is, let not <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſettle in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but come out: Remember <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that you have loſt the ſigns of my preſence, the Ark of my Covenant, the Mercy-ſeat, and all the tokens of my Love: and that you are now ſtrangers to me: ſo bring down their hearts, and make a way for my mercy, that I may do them good: that they long for my ſalvation, &amp; they shall find it ready at hand. Let them not truſt in their ſtrength, nor rely on the favour of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the world, the Flesh; for they will ſtill keep them bound: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to me, and I will deliver them: ſo that;</p>
            <p>No mercy to man nor ſalvation from God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt, nor holineſs by the ſpirit; but where God makes way in mans heart by dayly repentance, &amp; dayly turning mans heart from the world, himſelf: and all things in true ſenſe of his bondage, and longing of the ſoul after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Pſal. 107. <hi>He brought down their hearts with ſorrow, &amp; then had mercy on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all <hi>Iſraels</hi> wanderings, he plagues them, till he made them yield and cry and pray: &amp; then helps them in diſtreſſe. It was <hi>Johns</hi> office to make way for Chriſt; For what ſhould Chriſt do with an hardened heart, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with conceit of Wiſdom, righteouſneſſe and the world or riches: For all afflictions that God layes on man, either in the world, or in himſelf by the word; is but to bring down the heart, to let him ſee how the World hath deceived him, ſin hath beguiled him, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97089:98"/> his conceits brought him into a falſe ſurmiſe; and ſo lets him ſee, what a little power he hath in himſelf: that ſo forſaking and turning to another, he may find mercy</p>
            <p>For though God give gifts to man, yet they are kept onlie in the hand of Faith: elſe man turns to them, and forgets God and himſelf: and ſo becomes proud and conceited, &amp; becomes a Saviour to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But the ſalvation of God is never given but to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, that are aſhamed of themſelves, and their own curſed &amp; rebellious hearts, and in ſighing &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, pray &amp; ſeek for mercie.</p>
            <p>But we all would have ſalvation another way than by repentance, as one by knowing, another by dying, another by gathering ſtrength; but none by denying themſelves. Indeed we daily pray, <hi>Lord, forgive us our ſins:</hi> but ſin is not our burden, we would all have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to our hardened hearts. Nay, how far are we from the ſalvation of God, whoſe hearts never felt the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of repentance, or are again hardened through knowledge.</p>
            <p>We all dream of being ſaved, but alace! there is no way in thy heart: Thou knows how little thou minds God or Chriſt at all; how little thy heart is troubled about life or death: but carried away with preſent loſſe. Where is the place that can witneſſe thy ſorrow and heavineſſe of heart, thy ſighing &amp; folding of thy hands? how little is it in thy thoughts? What haſt thou done, &amp; daily doeſt againſt God or thy ſelf? How little art thou troubled about thy eternal being? no Repentance being wrought in thee, all Religion is but a matter of diſcourſe and circumſtance.</p>
            <p>But woe to us; for repenting dayes are gone: and ſo ſalvation hid: the time was, when we were ſinners, &amp; went mourning &amp; weeping, &amp; all our dayes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting dayes.</p>
            <p>And then were vve aſhamed to look into our ovvn curſed hearts &amp; vain vvayes, and all night our very dreams were on miſery; &amp; then light roſe in our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but now we are wiſe &amp; righteous, &amp; ſee not the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97089:98"/> pride &amp; luſt, &amp; worldlineſſe of our ovvn hearts, even drovvned in pride of our ovvn hearts, &amp; have a conceit of ſalvation in our ſelves. Is ſin leſſe ſinful than it was? Stand vve not as much need of ſalvation as before? nay, our hearts are not prepared for mercie, but claime it as a due, and therefore is ſalvation far from us.</p>
            <p>But know, that before ſalvation or freedom come from Chriſt to our hearts: theſe high looks muſt down, &amp; we carried into <hi>Babylon.</hi> God never caſts his mercy upon hardened hearts, but the poor &amp; mourners shall be comforted: So that faith &amp; holineſſe is daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by repentance &amp; deep humility, vvhen God opens the high vvay of our hearts, he gathers out the ſtones: &amp; all his mercies, though they bring comfort, yet ſtill more humbleneſſe, that he ſhould daily be ſo good &amp; we ſo vile &amp; rebellious; ſtill ſo is mercie &amp; ſalvation contained</p>

               <hi>Who is this that cometh from Edom.</hi> That is, from the land of captivitie, from <hi>Bozra</hi> the chief Citie of the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> repreſenting the great povver of Satan, Flesh and the World wherein man is bound, &amp; novv comes the Prince and Captain of our Salvation out of our capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and death, and is conſecrated through ſuffering, even in death overcoming all things: &amp; his garments red with the blood of the Sacrifice.</p>

            <p>For the vvhole Chapter is a Prophetical Declaration of Redemption by Chriſt, and the ſtate of man to be redeemed: as,</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who is this that cometh.</hi> This shews the expectation of the captive Church, waiting for a deliverer according
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97089:99"/> to the promiſe, after ſeventy weeks: ſo man after his long bondage under hell and Flesh, and ſeeing Chriſt a weak poor man, and that all in blood crucified, dead and buried: ſeems an unlikely man to reaſon, but in his anſwer, he puts away all doubts: &amp; that he is the only man and Redeemer: So that,</p>
            <p>The weary waiting and forlorn heart of man, though he ſee little poſſibility to obtain life by Chriſt in ſenſe &amp; reaſon, but many more likely devices; ye ſhall never find freedom but only in him.</p>
            <p>For he was ordained <hi>of old to break the Serpents head, and propheſied to bind up the broken hearted:</hi> Yet, what a doe had he with his Diſciples for to perſwade them that He was He? but ſtill they cried. Is not this <hi>Joſephs</hi> Son, is this likely to be He: He only was <hi>Jobs</hi> refuge in all his afflictions, when he ſaw nothing but death, yet his Redeemer liveth. This he witneſſeth by word and work. By word, <hi>I am come to ſave the World, I am the Reſurrection and the Life.</hi> By works, How many poor, lame and blind did He help, which He was after to do ſpiritually: the afflicted he comforted as, <hi>Mary</hi> and the <hi>Prodigal:</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> cryed out, Who is this that forgiveth ſins, that deſtroyes the Law? Nay, others ſaid, Except ye be circumciſed, Chriſt cannot profit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For he came to deſtroy the fleſh, and redeem the ſpirit: therefore was he weak in the fleſh, &amp; ſtrong in ſpirit, that he might croſs the curious witt and pride of man: who looked for great things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All things proſper according to his preſence with man, and not he according to the power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; all other things are but miſerable comforters, only puts off for a time, but it comes again with all violence: like a ſore that is ill healed.</p>
            <p>Yet, who hath believed this report, Nay, in any ſtraits we look for other helps. The World ſaith, Come ſee what riches and certaintie: I will relieve thy wants, be diligent, ply thy mind to me, and I will eaſe thee; and ſaith, Man: This is that comes with full hand and good gain: This is like to preſerve ſo much Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97089:99"/> ſo much coming in: and is yet never a whit eaſed, but a ſlave ſtill. The flesh ſaith, Come to me; I come not in ſadneſſe and ſorrow, but in mirth and paſtime, and pleaſure: I will put away ſorrow from thy heart, and ſeaſon all ſadneſſe with mirth: and yet for all this, in the midſt thereof the heart is ſorrowfull. Reaſon ſaith, Come to me, &amp; I will shew thee a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie way; do good, worke righteouſneſſe, ſee thy great knowledge, and good qualities: then believe that Chriſt may profit: but ſimple believing ſtands not in this, but in another thing: and when thou feels nothing in thy ſelf, Reaſon would judge this but a blind way.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſaith Chriſt, But come hither, look on me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my Word: I am poor and needie in flesh, and ſo muſt thou be: I will deliever thy Spirit, and free thy mind: theſe deceive thee, but I ſpeak in righteouſneſſe though I ſeem baſe, yet all power is given to me, and I am mighty to ſave. So that, he that looks for ſalvation by Chriſt had need of Faith, more than Witt: When the poor captive Soul ſees nothing, but death and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, no power to free himſelf; and ſees nothing but poor Chriſt, all wallowing in blood, shut up in the grave, ſits mourning at the Sepulchre: and yet look for ſalvation in him: had need to pray daily, <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Faith, and help our unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this end would Chriſt confirm his Diſciples in expectation of the Promiſe and Life by his Death, and to wait for the Holy Ghoſt by the Sacraments and pledges of his love and truth which he left them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I know ye doubt and fear, and hereafter ye shal ſee me forſaken, judged, and crucified, and buried: and then will your hearts tremble: but that I have ſpoken in Righteouſneſſe: take this as a pledge of my love and truth, when ye come together, eat and drink this, &amp; believe my Promiſe, &amp; rejoyce in me, &amp; in my death: for though I muſt trade the Wine preſſe alone, yet I will trade it in my Furie.</p>

            <p>For God will deſtroy all his enemies in man, that man may be freed, &amp; thoſe that ſtick to them ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with them: that we may be conformed to our head, &amp; ſo fitted for mercie in him, who came to ſuſtain man under vvrath: For hovv is he ſaved from wrath that is never under it? This vvere to ſave him in his fleſhlie way and hardneſſe of heart: That juſt Law vvhich man daily breaks, Thou ſhalt dye the death,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97089:100"/> muſt be true in all, and kill man, that the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may live in man, and he thereby.</p>
            <p>God doth this to bring down mans heart and make him yeeld, for man can ſhuffle off manie things, but this bitter hour paſt all help. But vve all ſtrive to go to Heaven vvith hardened hearts in beds of doune and worldly fullneſſe and eaſe: we make an agreement, &amp; think we are harmleſſe and innocent: and another, that he is a friend of God and his Word and Goſpel: &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is diligent, careful and righteous; and therefore thinks that he shall eſcape, and ſo would live and die without Repentance, Wrath and Miſerie; and yet Chriſt could not do that, and ſo none vvould drink of Chriſts Cup</p>
            <p>But knovv, thought vve can jeaſt and talk it out, &amp; clothe our ſelves with conceits, and opinions: yet God vvill trample all theſe under foot: When his Wrath shal be revealed from Heaven againſt all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe: either by his Word and Spirit in mans heart, that he shal ſay: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the bodie of this death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he shall knock at the door, or call for moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon him: then shall he ſee vvhat good he hath gotten vvith ſticking ſo hard to the World, and to himſelf, but all too late.</p>
            <p>But yet to a believing and yeelding heart, that jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf and not God, in midſt of Wrath, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members mercie: and even in this, he aims at mans good, though he ſee it not: For it is to vvhip and to beat mans proud heart, and fleshlie confidence, and to caſt out that proud and worldlie Devil, and deſtroy the enemies that are in mans heart.</p>
            <p>Thus the wanton heart of man fights for eaſe in the Land of captivitie, &amp; would ſee no evil, but flee from wrath, through hardneſſe of heart that cannot repent: and ſo heaps up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath.</p>
            <p>We would do evil, but would not feel it, nor hear of it: we vvould rebell againſt God, and follow our own
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97089:101"/> Luſts, that we may live, and yet would have him to put up all: Nay, but the wiſe Father knows that this is the way to undo the wanton child, and therefore caſts him off, leaves him to himſelf, that he may return by Repentance, ſaying, Thou knoweſt that I have been a Father to thee, I have provided for thee, when thou waſt young, I mantained thee: When thou waſt of age, thou would not be ruled: I was forced to caſt thee off. This now juſtlie come upon thee, yet ſeeing thou judgeſt thy ſelf, and juſtifies me, I will take away my Wrath, and receive thee to mercie, that thou mayeſt praiſe me. But, firſt, he makes them drink of his furie: but our curſed hearts cry for eaſe and reſt, but God will keep on the Rod till the heart be broken, and brought down, and make us like a drunken man, that is beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wine, that mindes neither Wife nor Children, eſtate nor credit: So with us, when his Wrath lyes on us, we can neither minde Wife, World, nor Children. For this ſticks cloſſe, and nothing can eaſe? Riches are vain. Pleaſures are gone, laughing is turned into mourning, and nothing can eaſe the heart but mercie: but how will theſe eſcape, when time of mercie is gone</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will bring down their ſtrength;</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Gods ſaving way to man, is to bring down the ſtrength of man in himſelf, that he may be exalted in another.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is an endleſſe Fountain of Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in God, and incomprehenſible mercie, which is never wanting to praying and miſerable hearts.</p>
            <p>But mans forſaking and turning from that, is the cauſe of all miſerie unto man, as Pſal. 81. Deut. 23. <hi>For he ſaid, Surely ye are my people,</hi> &amp;c. Here, he mentions his dealing with them in particular, that is to ſay, He ever had an eye over them for good, at leaſt to teſtifie his mercie, and,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He remembers their Adoption, with the truth and ſimplicitie of their hearts; and though now fallen, yet they were his people, and would not loſe their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97089:101"/>2. He was their Saviour, and delivered them out of afflictions, wherein he was alſo afflicted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There guide and governour, He led them all the dayes of old by the Angel of his preſence, &amp; then ſhews their Rebellion, &amp; his mercie again in pardoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are my people.</hi> This he ſpake in regard of his firſt chuſing of them, and uprightneſſe of their hearts then, and ſafetie they were in through his Power: So that,</p>
            <p>True hearted ſimple minded men, were &amp; ever ſhall be bleſſed of God, what ever gifts they have, when double and ſhuffling hearts ſhall be accurſed.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Davids</hi> plain and ſimple heart, when <hi>Nathan</hi> had opened his eyes, he did not ſhut them again; but though a King, and a fact diſcovered that might ſhame him, yet he goes not about to excuſe it, but confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth plainlie, and doth pennance to all poſteritie; yea, God is near to all that call upon him in truth, and the good ground are good honeſt and ſimple hearts; but the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that ſay they have no ſin, do lye, and deal not truelie: and a man is a lyer to the Holie Ghoſt, to think to joyn with the Diſciples in love, and yet keep the World in his heart to truſt to; and in Chriſt was found no guile; and God loves truth in the inward parts.</p>
            <p>For this is the opening and uncovering of the heart to be capable of mercie, and ſo hence comes confeſſing and believing with all the heart: For covering is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hardneſſe added to our former ſin: It was ſin in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to forſake God, but it was greater to cover it: and in <hi>Saul</hi> to ſpare <hi>Agag,</hi> but greater to excuſe it, and lie to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This is a fighting againſt Chriſt, and ſtrengthening our ſelves in ſomething elſe, that we might not ſtand in need of him: Like the malefactor, that hath done evil, and yet will excuſe it, and juſtifie himſelf, he will be hanged indeed.</p>
            <p>For God is a God of truth, and workes truth in the inward parts, and the power of truth is to diſcover the ſubtilitie of man and the Devil, and to convince
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97089:102"/> the World, and to lay the heart naked and bare before God.</p>
            <p>Away then with all doubling lyes, let God be true, and the Devil and everie man a lyer: From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vve all profeſſe to love God, and believe in him, but we lie. But, Whence, then is this care and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World, this fear, and ſorrow for loſſe: this pleading of our own Righteouſneſſe, to keep up conceit? We profeſſe to love God above all, but we lye: Whence then is this ſelf-love, &amp; of the World? and we forſake him for a Morſel of Bread; that we love our Brethren.</p>
            <p>Whence then is this malice and revenge, this oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and grinding, this cuſinning, and circumventing, and that we love the truth, and yet believe it not at all, but ſell it for our own wills, and that God would change his will, and rather than we want, our Luſts.</p>
            <p>We are all knowing and devote men, but honeſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie is loſt among main, plain dealing is gone: So in Religion, truth and ſimplicitie is gone: ſimple praying and believing from a troubled Spirit, is gone, ſimple love one to another, is gone: and everie one judging another; and locked up in ſecret ſurmiſing: not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with infirmities, but blazing abroad the frailties of others.</p>
            <p>But God will find out all our falshood one day, when all our excuſes shal be as shiftleſſe as to <hi>Adam:</hi> When he shall open the Books, and that are hid, layed open: Then shal thy Hypocriſie and double dealing be laid open, whither thou haſt truſted God, or thy ſelf; loved Him, or the World: Then shal it be ſeen, whether thou believed indeed and in truth: For true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence shal come againſt thee a malefactor which thou canſt not denie.</p>
            <p>It is not our ſimple ſinning that hinders our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for God will pardon? but it is our lying and covering it that hides us from Chriſt: As the Child that hath not onlie made a fault, but hides and covers it, is beaten double. This his Father cannot abide.</p>
            <p>God gives us true and ſimple hearts, we ſeek great
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97089:102"/> gifts and qualities, and become wiſe; but loſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and run from our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted.</hi> And the Angel of his preſence <hi>ſaved them.</hi> Here is Chriſt ſuffering, who bare the infirmities of man in all weakneſſe; So that,</p>
            <p>Chriſt the loving Saviour of man, partakes with man in all his miſerie; and lovingly helps when all fails, Heb. 2. <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children were partakers of flesh and blood,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 5. <hi>He is a faithful high Prieſt ſubject to like infirmities;</hi> And was partaker with all that was miſerable: but the Wealth and Glorie of the World he had none of: Like a loving elder-brother that ſees his younger overburthned, helps him: beaten, weeps, and hungry gives him meat.</p>
            <p>For he was the Word of the Father, &amp; was God, yet he took upon him the form of a ſervant, and became flesh, and dwelt among us, that we might ſee him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted, ſuffering, forſaken; and yet he overcame all.</p>
            <p>For he came to help the afflicted, therefore he came in the flesh, that he might deſtroy flesh; &amp; by enabling man to ſuffer, deſtroying fleshly luſt in man.</p>
            <p>Thus was he given as a witneſſe to the people, &amp; the firſt-begotten of many: What then means theſe high thoughts, &amp; ſoaring conceits that ſeek Chriſt in heaven, and think Him to be ſome angry ſpirit: and ſo rack their thoughts and beat their brains in comprehending Him, but lo, He is with the poor, afflicted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken this high and full Religion he cares not for, nor hath any communion therewith.</p>
            <p>What a hearting then is this to patience, that like a loving husband, is with the wife in well and woe: thou thinks thy caſe ſingular, none like thee: thou poor, He poorer; thou wants the fathers love, ſo did he; thou art perſecuted, ſo he; unto death; thou ſick, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:97089:103"/>
            <p>All high flying Religion then is not of Chriſt, for he hath no communion with man, but in affliction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> deſired only to be partaker in his afflictions, for he hath not to do with rich men at eaſe, and he that ſaith, He hath fellowship with him and not in his death lyes and deals not truly.</p>
            <p>It is not affliction that hurts or hinders man, but want of Faith; for he is afflicted with us, but becauſe we do not believe his power and truth, nor are we pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to want reſt, therefore are we crushed under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: we have not learned to loſe the world and our ſelves with him; the fire cannot fear them.</p>
            <p>And where man is partaker with Chriſt in afflictions he makes him alſo partaker with others, to mourn with them that mourn.</p>
            <p>But we are little diſpoſed to the practice of Faith, while we judge others in ſtead of pardoning, we ſpread abroad their Infirmities, we ſpoil the poor: but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerable men have a friend at back that is with them: giving a mouth and wiſdom, when friends and world fail: yet then He abides and fails not, but when they have leaſt hope, they have readieſt help and when they are weak, then are they the ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Angel of his preſence.</hi> When they were brought low in affliction, and ſate in ſorrow, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe repenting hearts, then his love breaks out; So that, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nay, we are not for His preſence, like an adulterous Wife that cares not for her Husbands preſence: but if ever that heart be turned by Repentance, and poſſeſt of its own guilt, then none but He.

            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:97089:104"/>
            <p>As Gods love and pity without any thing in man, is the firſt fountain of life to man and only cauſe of his happineſs; ſo is the ſame Love, Goodneſſe and Power, the dayly preſervation and guide of man in the way of happineſs through Faith.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Paul, by the grace of God, I am that I am, not I, but the grace of God in me:</hi> therefore doth the Lord ſo often remember <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> that they might look at that Law, and depend on that Promiſe.</p>
            <p>How came <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of all theſe ſtraits, but that God ſtill pityed and forgave them, as <hi>David,</hi> how he prayed to be guided and preſerved and relieved dayly from God And this the Apoſtle ſtrove for, that nothing might ſtand in the heart of man after grace received, but the ſame grace ſtill: and further beats down all things elſe but this.</p>
            <p>For is not man as weak in himſelf, and Satan and the Flesh as ſtrong as ever? Is not man as ſinful, and His grace and help as needful as ever?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf could not live, but Chriſt lived in him, and he waited therein, <hi>He hath delivered, and will deliver me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt did not worke properly for himſelf, for man to guide himſelf by his own power: for this is not in man but in Chriſt, who is his Safetie, Peace, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and Holineſſe, and all: for <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not able to ſtand before any enemie when they forſook the Covenant, for what ſhall uphold man under the croſs, but his love and pity when all fails,</p>
            <p>As the Martyrs, was it their wit, or power, or ſtrength of heart that preſerved them? No, but the Power and Truth of Chriſt through Faith: For as the child hath nothing of his own, but lives at the fathers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and providence: ſo we.</p>
            <p>See then, it is not as wiſe unbelieving men imagine, that after the myſterie of the Goſpel be revealed, and apprehended in fleſh, turns back with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe and righteous and ſtrong in themſelves; ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97089:105"/> it is with many that were ſinners: but God received them to mercy, and now they worke it out, beginning in the ſpirit, but ending in the flesh, and then think to recompence God.</p>
            <p>Is God more beholden to thee than before, or rather is not thy ſinful luſt, and pride, and worldly heart, and hypocriſie as hateful to God now: when thou haſt the knowledge of his will as thou thinkeſt.</p>
            <p>But theſe are commonly the greateſt backſliders; For though they ſtick unto Religion, yet they fall from Chriſt in Religion and conceit, and clothe themſelves with his gifts: The World is in their hearts, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance gone, Prayer dead, Faith only in name.</p>
            <p>So that, to thoſe he shal have juſt complaint; one is rich in the World, and cares not for his bleſſing, but he will turn it to a curſe: another, is wiſe to guide himſelf, but will prove a fool and wander: another, is Righteous and rich in Knowledge, but a thief to God, and his mercie moſt shut from him: Whence, God shall judge and ſay, Thou of all others shouldeſt have truſted me, thou profeſt my Name, ſat by my ſide: but thou art the great thief of all, for thou haſt robbed me of my glorie, thou ran from me in pride: therefore, thou of all others art the fartheſt off mercie.</p>
            <p>See the wonderful love of God towards man, that pities man, that pities not himſelf: When the ſturdie Child hath run away, yet having wrought his peace, he calls him back by his Word and pardons him: when the weak heart of man feels Danger and Wrath, and feels no eaſe to comfort him: when he is perſecuted, and knows not what to anſwer, God puts a Word in his mouth.</p>
            <p>What a fool then is man, that hath ſuch a pitiful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attending for his good in all, and yet runs to the World and fleſh, thoſe cruel Tyrants, and ſeeks help there.</p>
            <p>So dayly mercie in God, and miſerie in man, &amp; Faith in Gods Word, is mans preſervation.</p>
            <p>Pray we then, that the Truth of the Goſpel, &amp; Faith
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97089:105"/> may be preached in the Church, that man may have nothing to lean to but mercie; but how hard is this new way to continue, but we would ſtil have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to feel and lean to, but not his mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his Holie Spirit.</hi> Such is the curſed nature and rebellious flesh of man: So that,</p>
            <p>Such is the rebellion of the fleſhly nature of man, that the more goodneſſe and love God shews to man, he is the more rebellious and wanton againſt God, &amp; forgetful of himſelf to the loſing of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 2 <hi>David</hi> caſts off God, when his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was ſtrong and <hi>Jude: They turn the grace of God unto wantonneſſe: And I nourished a people, and they have forſaken me:</hi> they abuſed the Patience of God.</p>
            <p>This is plain in experience, though God hath given us all enough in the World, that we ſee, or may ſee his bleſſing; who might have fruſtrated thy labour? yet how l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For man dots on every thing, that he quite forgets the fountain, and makes it a foundation of future hopes</p>
            <p>Hence cometh ſo much looking at what we have ſeen and felt, and reckoning up old ſtore, and thence arguing our preſent happineſſe.</p>
            <p>We are grown hardened and ſecure, and it may be, ſhal never taſte the like again.</p>

            <p>But what a curſed thing is the heart of man, that God can do him no good, but he turns it to evil? as in all: thou never prays nor ſeeks heartily to God, but when need pincheth thee: then thou cryes: but if he eaſe thee, thou caſts Him off: As <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both in the wilderneſſe and <hi>Canaan,</hi> to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Beth-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And ſo in the Worlding, God hath given all it into his hand, and he hath let into his heart, &amp; made a god of it, &amp; that World &amp; worldly mind as God, he truſts it &amp; loves it above him, ſaying, This is it that muſt eaſe my heart, ſo he grinds the poor, and oppreſſeth the needy.</p>

            <p>Others, he hath pardoned a thouſand times, and they are grown wanton, hardened and preſumptuous to caſt themſelves down: thinking, but not believing that he will pardon, what ever they have done.</p>
            <p>Others, have health and ſtrength; and do nothing, but ſerve their own Luſts: So that there is great danger in proſperitie: there Satan traps man, than man grows ſecure, forgetful, and wanton: Watch, for there is danger of the Devil; ſhutting the heart in that fullneſſe, and ſo ſtops the currant of his grace,</p>
            <p>No thriving in Religion but under the Croſſe, for man is never ought but then: What a rebellions crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is man, and untoward child; that becauſe God is good, therefore he will be nought: The Father cannot ſmile, but the child grows way-ward, but when God ſeems evil, man is the beſt: but do we provoke him to anger, or our ſelves to our own deſtruction; for he will ſay, I did thee good, and ſent the Wealth &amp; Health, &amp; Riches, and would never have failed thee.

            <p n="1">1. Thus is man deceived, when having had ſome light and love of God to ſhine in his dark Soul, thinks all is done, and Heaven obtained, and ſo grows pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous inſtead of believing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Either proud, becauſe he imagines to have power over himſelf in all, which is only in God, or ſecurely preſumes on Gods power without either fear of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or Life of Truth upholding him, and ſo is dayly led into temptation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou shalt ſometimes ſee the World ſmiling, and offering a fair bait and portion, and thy flesh gaping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and thouſands enſnared thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes good conceits, and by thoughts from that thou knoweſt, or from thy well qualified mind, which thou thinks adds much to thy Faith, but after theſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt die.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or ſometimes want, fear and trouble, looks grim at thee, and threatens the downfal of all, and if Faith do not uphold thee, how wilt thou ſtand: nay, thou ſhalt ſee ſecret luſts and deſires, and delights in thy heart eaſe, and peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which muſt all down, ſo that if God keep not Faith alive in man, wearie and uncertain is his way.</p>
            <p>But let all lock for it, after many temptations ſtill greater behind: one deep calls another, for man by the abuſe of the liberty of Faith grows ſecure and proud, &amp; that muſt down by the croſſe: we think when it is fair, it will never be ſoul, and when we are rich, we shall never be poor.</p>
            <p>Nay, but know that a quarter croſſe muſt come to pull that down: for that great enemy, that is, Death, is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97089:108"/> not yet vanquiſhed, skin for skin, and all for life; ſo that the ſafe path of man is, to ſettle in nothing, but dwell with God, for <hi>Abraham</hi> might think now all is ſafe, ſeing <hi>Iſaac</hi> is born, and well grown; but no ſafetie in that, for after a calm comes a ſtorm, as we ſee it in the courſe of all things: ſo in mans heart day and then night, light and then darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>God doth not take delight in afflicting his people, but rather than they shall return to the world, and delight and be deceived by the Flesh, that his truth should ſeem a lie, he will beat and ſtrike the flesh, to the death, with one croſſe after another, till it be ſubdued.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus we know, God hath com'd near us with many afflictions, and like <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when it is paſt, to fall to our courſes again; but he will come nearer at laſt, till he bind us to himſelf that we dare not deſire to ſtart from him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And we ſee what brings temptations &amp; croſſes, that is to ſay, when flesh makes uſe of Gods truth to its own advantage, that man begins to think of eaſe and peace in the Flesh, then muſt the croſſe come or elſe thou wilt be loſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But where will be our refuge when <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be ſlain, for this will come: we have now fulneſſe, health and peace, and proſperity and mercies of God on every ſide, but the day of temptation muſt come, when we muſt part with our deareſt ſons and careful father, thy kind mother and loving ſiſter, thy beloved world and life it ſelf: What then shall ſtay thee, or whether wilt thou flee? For be ſure this day is coming on all Fleſh. O happy he that hath the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uth of God to ſuſtain him, and an obedient heart, a ſubject will, and a patient ſoul that day: for to him only shall <hi>Iſaac</hi> be raiſed from death, and be life in death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God did tempt and prove Abraham.</hi> This a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tryal, for otherwiſe God tempts no man, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. Not that God was ignorant what was in him, but that God might manifeſt to the world the power and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Fai h, and to shew what is the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97089:108"/> deliverance in all ſtraits, that all believers may be bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>God ſent this temptation to the purifying of his faith, and weakening of the Flesh, that nothing might be left to <hi>Abraham</hi> but God and his power and Truth to reſt on, but God alone: thus to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. Deliver them into the hand of their enemies, that their truſt in the Ark might fail: Thus to <hi>David,</hi> when he had numbred the People, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. When his mountain was made ſtrong.</p>
            <p>For hereby he purifieth Faith like gold, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be <hi>winnowed as wheat:</hi> for then all rejoicing is taken away in the flesh, when World and all fails.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For he ſeeth that man is apt to joyn with flesh againſt God, therefore he keepeth this down by daylie ſuffering: for man is lothe to lay hands on himſelf, therefore doth he fight againſt it in man, both by Word which if it prevaile not, he adds blows to weaken the Fleſh, that ſo man may ſee what a weak ſtaff he hath truſted to: and often he croſſeth his children therein when they have forſaken God: He takes away the World, becauſe thou haſt run to and truſted it; he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers thee to fall becauſe thou truſts to thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: He hides his face becauſe the Flesh grows wanton by his comforts: Thus God daylie croſſeth us, and we take no notice, and lay the blame on this or that, and flee to the World for help: but then he will come and whipe thee yet more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the croſſe ly long on thee, the cauſe is, becauſe there is yet ſome looking for help from Fleſh, or ſome luſt that will not yield: thy ſtubborn heart is yet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by fleſhly hope: For when God hath accompliſht his ends, then shall freedom come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſeeth, that if we should proſper ſtill, we ſhould be undone: for fulneſſe of Flesh, and ſimple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſeldom go together: nay, he will ſtill keep to ſuch a dyet, as thou ſhalt ſtill have: So will he keep thee under ſome croſſe or temptation, that thou shalt ſtill need his help, and by this Faith, ſee his power and truth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:97089:109"/>4. That is Faith then and Religion that holds out in tryal, for afflicti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Thereby Faith is purified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The flesh weakened.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And love increaſed, for then is man pitiful to others</p>
            <p n="4">4. The word proſpers, but never thrives but when the croſſe goes with it: For full hearts are unfit to receive it, and man at eaſe eaſily ſhuffles it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take thy ſon, thy only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt.</hi> This God ſaw in him, and would bring it under, to ſepare his heart from his deareſt object to him only, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the only ſon of nature and of promiſe: So that,</p>
            <p>So there is in man, ſome only ſon by nature, of ſome dear object, which he loves, and wherewith he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, which muſt be ſlain before man come to live in conſtant peace and fellowship with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> had great poſſeſſions, there it in the world a luſt of the eye and flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For man fixeth on ſomething in want of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While this lives, the ſoul lives in and by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This muſt dy or man muſt perish.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And ſo far as mans heart fixeth on this, it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats from God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So that the promiſe of Faith, and living thereby, doth ſepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Acts</hi> 21. <hi>For there
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97089:109"/> through the world is crucified, and nature brought into ſubjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For not to love <hi>Iſaac</hi> is unatural, and yet to dote on him, or to be tyed to him, or place felicitie in him, is bondage, and argues a ſelf-will and love not mortified, as in <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abſalom;</hi> hereby,</p>
            <p n="3">3. God doth wonderfully free his people when by faith He knits man to himſelf: He layes nature under foot, that man may ſo enjoy all things in God, that his eyes may be ſtill towards him, that he uſeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth, as not uſing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is to enjoy all things as lawful, that is, a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſe of all things, and yet not to be brought under the power of any thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Away then with all halt and heartleſſe obedience, when man out of fleshly knowledge ſeems to flatter God with a few ſacrifices, which are nothing but the overplus and ſuperfluitie of thy peacefulneſſe &amp; fleshly will; but when he comes to be tryed to the bott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bedience in all; when mans luſt hath ceaſed on an object and will not part: but is a law, that therein he fights againſt God in the way of Faith and Love, and man in the common way of Equitie, that ſo have it, he will: though to his own and everie one a beloved <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is, the treaſure of his heart; which though he will communicat other things, yet this he keeps in his cloſet.</p>
            <p>Yea, man hath not only a natural love to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but further, thinks while it is but ſo, all is well: as to love wife and children, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But know this, when it exceeds reaſon, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call it, <hi>Dotting affection;</hi> it brings man into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but more when it ſeparats from God: For there is a love natural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which is ſoon ſatisfied, and there is a violent affection that ever breeds bondage; which placeth a happineſs in that thing loved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus we ſee, everie man hath his <hi>Iſaac</hi> that muſt be ſlain; for as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the natural ſon, yet muſt be ſacrificed: So man hath not only the fruit of his own
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97089:110"/> natural wit, but even the joyes, peace &amp; freedom that comes by the promiſe, that muſt be ſlain, or at leaſt be offered to God, that man may not depend on theſe, but on the promiſe: that ſo he live not by high Revelations, but by the grace of God which is ſufficient, as in <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All obedience that iſſues not out of the ashes of Faith, or from the power of Gods love reſted on by Faith, is nothing: for not to obtain or coyn a Faith thereby, but as a true expreſſion of a believing heart: And this shews Gods goodneſs to man, croſſing him of his chiefeſt object, that ſo he may not cleave to it, but reſt in God and his Truth alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there.</hi> Here is the great tryal of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he muſt offer <hi>Iſaac</hi> in whom the promiſe reſted: So that he takes away from his people all ſtayes in the Flesh, yea, not only his beloved Son in nature, but alſo the Son of the Promiſe: and everie part in whom the Promiſe ſhould be accomplished: So that now <hi>Abraham</hi> hath nothing left but bare promiſe, and all thoſe means whereby the promiſe should be accomplished taken away: So that,</p>
            <p>God will ſooner, or latter take away from his people all ſtayes in the flesh, though never ſo likelie in Flesh or reaſon, that the believing heart may be bared and weakned, and reſt purelie and ſimplie on God and his Truth.</p>
            <p>Thus he took from his Diſciples, even Chriſt in the Flesh, alſo from <hi>Gideon,</hi> his great hoſte: from the <hi>Jews</hi> their Temple and Ark, wherein they truſt: yea, <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> it ſelf, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might come from Heaven, which is the Mother of us all, from <hi>David</hi> his high mountain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus God keeps his Children weak and poor in the Flesh, that they may ſeek to him, &amp; be ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his power and Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus he makes way for believing, for while man hath any thing to look at, his eyes are turned from God nor doth he purelie believe in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. O! This promiſe is onlie open to the weak and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97089:110"/> poor, as Matth. 5. For none taſtes of Wrath that fears it, nor none fails through weakneſſe that feels it: The ſturdie Oaks are shaken with the ſtorm, when the bending Reed eſcape through yeilding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though God have given <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt not truſt to him: ſo God gives joy, and Peace, according to the Promiſe yet may we not leave the Promiſe, and truſt to theſe, nor tye the Promiſe to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Vain then is the ſtay of them, that have no other foundation, but what Flesh yeilds, which is nothing but shame: as alſo, thoſe that tye God, and limit him to theſe, and believe only becauſe of theſe: as the Worldling, becauſe of Riches, the Phariſee, becauſe of Righteouſneſſe: and Believers, which turn from the Promiſe, and fix on theſe onlie, are deceived: For God gives theſe at his pleaſure, but his Truth muſt reſt as mans Foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But how will man do, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be ſlain, &amp; all thy hopes in the Fleſh taken away: As thy Riches, Libertie, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where wil thy reſt be then, as it was with the Martyrs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus we ſee, how God in croſſing man, bleſſeth him, by cauſing the outward man to periſh, ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man is renewed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Happie he, that enjoyes all things in the Flesh, but fix on nothing, but enjoy, as not enjoying: rejoyceth, as not rejoycing: uſeth, as not uſing: But if man fix on any thing after the Flesh, it is the readie way to loſe it: as to the <hi>Jewes</hi> Temple, and <hi>Davids</hi> high Mountain</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham went three dayes journey.</hi> And all this while he shewed not the place, that Reaſon and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction might worke their utmoſt ſpite in tryal of Faith: So that,</p>
            <p>So doth God with man, he often defers deliverance to man, and hides from him a long time the purpoſe of his Love, that man may wait in Faith, &amp; be weakned in flesh, and in waiting be delivered.</p>
            <p>Thus he made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to wait four hundred years, the Church wait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>b. 2.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This he doth to hide Pride from mans heart, and to make the World a fool, that when man moſt expects it, he defers it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God hath a revealed will, which man is to believe: but a ſecret will, man is to wait on</p>
            <p n="3">3. God, firſt workes all things down in man, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parats the heart from them before he comes</p>
            <p n="4">4. For God hath an end, and man hath need of ſore afflictions, and when theſe are brought about, then will God come. Thus the husband man waits for the harveſt: Firſt, it is buried in the earth a long time, then appears a little, but ſubject to manie froſts, blaſts, and diſaſters, yet he waits thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man draws on his miſerie, by anticipating God his thoughts, We think now, and now with <hi>David. O! when shall I come and appear before thee, and mine eyes ſail with waiting,</hi> and yet he withholdeth: For thou art not yet ſubject, when thou ſees the Wiſdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, that thou can as willingly lye under, as wisht to be delivered, then shal thou be freed: but ſo long as there remains a Will of thy own croſſing his, this muſt firſt be brought under: For God ſends light in darkneſſe, life in death, therefore, becauſe we are not yet dead, nor in darkneſſe, the Promiſe is deferred: it is not enough that thou haſt a foundation of Truth, but thou wild needs have a ſign and aſſurance in flesh for the Spirit to reſt on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath given his Word and Promiſe that man is to wait on, but we are loth to travel three dayes, and ſtay till God shew it: God hath ſaid, I will deliver thee, but we would ſee ſome ſign of it, he ſayes, I will deliver thee, but we would have ſome other aſſurance than his Word of Truth, that is, Man would have ſome other ſtay beſide Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:97089:111"/>3. Wait then thou wearie Soul on God though thou ſee no means, for deliverance will come: the weakling cryes out, becauſe he is not now delivered, he is quite forſaken: but God knows, thou haſt a wanton wit and rebellious will to be ſubdued.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay, when God shews nothing but death, and to the eye of man, that life is fartheſt off: then is it the neareſt: <hi>Abraham</hi> might be wearie, but God ſtayed him: but patience with hope, preſerved him: Man is wearie of Gods hand, even almoſt before he feel it, &amp; dreams of nothing but deliverance: even like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient man, that feeling the biting Coraſſue, would have the plaiſter taken of, but the Wiſe Surgeon knowed, that the rotten fleſh muſt be eaten out: ſo God will have the Flesh to be quiet, &amp; the Spirit ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before he remove his Rod.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a whole burnt offering:</hi> By which he was to be conſumed, that there should be no memorial left, for ſo was the laws of the burnt-offerings: So that,</p>
            <p>Gods will is to be believed and obeyed of man without reſervation, and the Flesh and World to be crucified without ſparing any part thereof of all theſe that would reſt in God.</p>
            <p>He will be loved with all the heart, and we muſt have no God but him: For this is the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt not leave a hoof behind in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he will be loved above Father or Mother.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For look what a man reſerves to himſelf, he draws from God, and denieth him: acknowledging ſome other Gods beſides him, and ſo the mind runs after it, as <hi>Adam</hi> did: and ſo we halt betwixt two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be ſpared a little, preſentlie it gets ſtrength, &amp; will ariſe again, and ſo is a halting betwixt two.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Man ſpairs and reſerves, but that wherein he thinks there is a good beſides God, and ſo the heart runs after it, and ſo deſtroyes Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some indeed wholly ſpare <hi>Iſaac</hi> the World, and cannot abide to be touched.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:97089:112"/>2. Others offer their refuſe with <hi>Cain,</hi> but reſerve <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nay, believers will ſtill have ſome hold in the flesh, ſome reſervation; ſo hard a thing is it to ſacrifice all, they would have part of the World: ſome eaſe, peace, freedom, ſome aſſurance of Life and Goſpel: but all theſe muſt be ſacrificed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Religion that is true, is then a ſimple thing and cannot mix it ſelf with any thing, like quick-ſilver, or the turtle-dove.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then the obedience of Gods Children if it be ſimple it is total to all his will, though never ſo hard to flesh and blood.</p>
            <p>For theſe cannot enter into the Kingdom, and if it be in God and for God, why then not one as well as another: for all are a like in him, that is wholly given to God by Faith in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So Abraham went three dayes journey.</hi> And yet ſaw nothing, that Satan might all this while tempt and trye him, and yet God ſtill preſerves him: This is Gods dealing to believing man: So that,</p>
            <p>God uſually tryes his to the bottom, that they may be ſaved in the Faith, and shew forth his power of truth and promiſe to all.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 77. Thus <hi>Paul;</hi> Chriſt &amp; his Martyrers: thus was Satan let looſe upon <hi>Abraham,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For while man is but croſt a little, he runs to other fleshly help, from one ſhift to another, as here <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might Reaſon though I be banished, yet I have the Promiſe, and though it be long deferred, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> is now born, but here God ſtrikes down all theſe proppes at once.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth thus worke good out of evil to man, he lets Satan looſe to beat and canviſſe man in the flesh; and drive him out, for he is the God of the World, and muſt rule there, that he may drive man home to God, but if man will make a Covenant with him, and ſtay there, he will be his Lord, and reward him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Man wil catch hold of any thing before he be well drowned, even a Leaf or Reed, but God plungeth him into the deep, &amp; then he calleth from thence.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:97089:112"/>1. We have not yet reſiſted unto blood, no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath taken us, but ſuch as man can remove with the World or Reaſon fixed on the Truth revealed, or qualities: and ſo we get ſin a hiding place in the flesh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Believers need yet a great deal of purging through affliction, for ſtill we retain ſomething, becauſe of which we hope and believe; but this is not plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, nor pure believing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But know, that day will come, when God will trye us to the bottom, and leave neither Father nor Mother, Wit, nor Wiſdom: we ſhal be put paſt all our ſhifts in the flesh: So that,</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſee what a doe God hath to bring man low enough: hence it is, that we are not enlivened, enriched and made free in God, becauſe we are not poor, weak and blind in the flesh, but find eaſe there and reſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus God ſecretlie upholdeth his Children in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, though themſelves ſee not how they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he ſtill ſends Life in Death, who know not how they are raiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stay here, and I and the Lad;</hi> All left him, and he left theſe behind: So that,</p>
            <p>If man go to aſcend to God, and meet him comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie in any ſtrait, no coming with Flesh and blood: but leave theſe, and fix on him in naked belief.</p>
            <p>So <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Goliah:</hi> ſo Chriſt was left alone, &amp; none to aſſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For flesh and blood cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and His wayes cannot be comprehended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Fleshly affection draw men to their own ends, but Faith only layes hold on Chriſt: theſe harden the heart, &amp; give a hope without Faith, which God wil not accept</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe deſtroy Faith, for the Soul cannot live on both: thus would worldly men fain take the World to Heaven with them: yea, all are lothe to leave all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but would have ſomething to bear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, what ever makes for hurting of mans flesh is mans death, let Flesh know nothing, nor rule nothing</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Angel ſaid, Stay thy hand.</hi> Here <hi>Abraham</hi> is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97089:113"/> brought to the pits brink, and ſees no deliverance, but only is preſerved by Faith, they ſaw nothing but death before them; <hi>Iſaac</hi> willing and <hi>Abraham</hi> readie and content, both preſerved by Faith, and ſubjected; So that,</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for man to meet death willingly, or think thereof: but only when lively power of Faith upholds, and hath killed and crucified the Flesh and will thereof by the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This made <hi>Paul</hi> willing to leave this tabernacle: <hi>David</hi> to commend his ſpirit into the hands of God, and Chriſt his life to the father, and Martyrs to the fire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Flesh fears deſtruction of it ſelf, and if it be not overcom'd and preſerv'd by another power, it dyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time; death makes on end of all and leaves nothing, neither father nor friends, land nor riches but deſtroyes all: for as here, <hi>Iſaac</hi> is gone, all <hi>Abraham</hi> children at once, the means of promiſe, and alſo if that his life had been herein, he had utterly failed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the great luſt and enemie to be deſtroyed, for, <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will be give for his life:</hi> and yet to this we muſt all paſſe, it makes death ſo fearful to worldly hearts, it leavs nothing to hold by: other loſſes leave ſome hope of recoverie but this without Redemption; and yet this will come, we ſee it before our eyes, even death coming when thou muſt part with thy deareſt husband, loving wife, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar, and ſee how thou wilt hear it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, this makes death fearful to believers, becauſe the Flesh is not mortified, but lives in them, &amp; deſires to live: and becauſe they live not in God, would yet live in the world. All put this day afa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> off, one is yet luſty and ſtrong, or is yet weak, hopes to recover, and yet never willing to commune with death, becauſe we live not in and by the death of the World: another is old, yet thinks he may yet laſte many years: So that,</p>
            <p>Only the believing man, in whom life is already
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97089:113"/> overcome, shal die chearfully: as <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I can die at Jeruſalem:</hi> He ſees that death shall free him from the world; the Flesh, luſt and all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stay thine hand.</hi> Now God comes with help at a pinch, when it is not expected; if <hi>Abraham</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iring expectation of due deliverance this way, God would yet have tryed him further: but ſeeing paſt help, and yet believing, he comes: So that,</p>
            <p>God comes to help his people in the fitteſt time, &amp; when man in reaſon ſees no help in the world or in himſelf: then is God ready at hand.</p>
            <p>As at the Red ſea, ſo to <hi>Elisha,</hi> when the King of <hi>Aſſiria</hi> had beſieged him in <hi>Dothan,</hi> there were moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains full of Chariots of fire: So to <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> Pſal. 107. <hi>Hungry and thirſty, then they cried unto the Lord:</hi> The <hi>Publicans</hi> cried, <hi>Lord, be merciful to me,</hi> &amp;c</p>
            <p n="1">1. For at firſt, God made all things out of nothing, and ſo brings light out of darkneſſe, and the poor to confound the rich.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the heart hath paſſed all fleshly power, then he reſts in faith: for he hath nothing to truſt to. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thereby are the ſufferings of Chriſt accomplished in the Saints in earth, as with the Martyrs; when friends mourned, ſtrangers bewailed, acquaintance pitied, their adverſaries boiled in all wrath: and all hope of life paſt: yet then was God with them, and they joyful; as with the man that cried, <hi>Auſtin,</hi> He is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Yea, thus doth God weaken Flesh, by diſſannuling the hope thereof: and makes his power known in flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie weakneſſe: for he both ſecretlie upholds at preſent, and ſends help when all is paſt hope.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter he comforts the Church againſt all darkneſſe and deſolation, threatned in the ſeventh &amp; eigth chapters: and that by promiſe of the <hi>Mesſiah:</hi> alluding to theſe calamities, that came both by <hi>Tilgath
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97089:114"/> Pileazer,</hi> 2 Kings 15. And that great <hi>Salmanazer,</hi> King of <hi>Asſiria,</hi> where all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was led captive, 2 Kings 17. And thirdly, yet greater, when <hi>Zenaucharib</hi> came upon them, in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> with two hundred thouſand ſouldiers, and railed on the living God, even in that darkneſs, when they had no hope of ſafety. Then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpred his letter before the Lord, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet brought the meſſage of ſafetie, and that without the power of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or any man God would overcome: and ſo ſent his Angel, and ſlew one hundred fourſcore and fifty thouſand of the <hi>Asſirians</hi> Armies: and here ſaith he, ſhall our deliverance be. He ſhewes, it ſhall not be by mans power, no more than that: For thou multiplied the Nations, that is of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they had a greater Army than before, yet more afraid: but now they rejoyce as men in harveſt. He ſhewes the reaſon, for the yoke and burden of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor is removed, and that without the power of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even as in the day of <hi>Midian:</hi> then,</p>
            <p>A compariſon of theſe, every battel is with blood, but this ſhalt be with conſuming fire: Thou haſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied the Nations, but not increaſed the joy. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> had again gathered ſtrength, yet behold, greater fear than before, 1 King. 19.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for he never left afflicting, till he had waſted all their ſtrength, and put them paſt it; till they bowed down in humility and fear, and ſpred the letter before the Lord; then comes the Angel; ſo with us: So that,</p>
            <p>It is not increaſing our ſtrength, wiſdom or any gift, that eaſeth or rejoyceth the heart indeed: but man walking in faith, fear and humility and love, shall be comforted in God.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> but ſtill worſe thereby: So the fool, Luk. 12. Jerem. 10. <hi>Let not the wiſe man rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For we are kept by the power of Faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the mourner that is comforted, not the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97089:114"/> yea, the poor that is inriched, and the rich ſent empty away: <hi>Sowe in tears, and reap in joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For hereby is the great power of God manifeſted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus we ſee the World ſtill multiplies riches and wealth, but not joy increaſed: ſo we all ſtrive for this and that guilt, knowledge, righteouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo we multiply our ſtrength &amp; conceit of Power in man, as though he would overcome the King of <hi>Ashur;</hi> yet this ſtill riſeth in man, but is the greateſt oppoſite to Faith of all things. 2. Happy is he that caſts down all, and ſpreads the heart before the Lord, who in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf trembles in every thing, and flies by faith to God; the Angel shall come in time, &amp; man shall overcome, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did, Judges 27. <hi>God took from him all his ſtrength:</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All that were fearful, and all that lay down to drink; ſo with us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes away Infidelity, which was fearful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Earthlineſſe, and moves man to ſuffer, and then in that wearied and tyred eſtate, he gives victorie to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Mans victorie is obtained in weakneſſe of man by the power of God: and till God have taken from him that ſtrength and wiſdom whereby he ſtandeth, he never conquers: as <hi>Paul: When I am weak, then am I ſtrong: of my ſelf not able to think a good thought, but through his grace able to do all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For fear &amp; weakneſſe goes before faith, then faith follows: and if faith be preſerved, then man is ſafe: but if a man waxe ſtrong in conceit: then farewell faith &amp; fear, and then hardneſſe comes.</p>
            <p>All the whole Scripture workes to bring man down that he might reſt in God, though he feel no ſtrength, though he feel no reaſon, though be be in darkneſſe; yet the promiſe in Chriſt dwells in all theſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For God is not in thunder &amp; earthquake &amp; winds, but in the ſoft, ſtill voice, &amp; reſting heart of man in him</p>
            <p n="1">1. But man hath witt and lives by it; will, &amp; followes is power, and guardes: but all will fail: For where
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97089:115"/> Infidelity is, or thoſe that went on in worldlineſſe, theſe were ſent back: for there was thirty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but ten thouſand went: and of theſe all, but three hundred that kneeled down to drink.</p>
            <p>So with us, moſt turn back from Chriſts battle through infidelity: and others that ſeem to follow Chriſt moſt are ſubdued by the World: only a few content with preſent ſtate follow the Lord in Faith: For in the moſt things we do fear through diſtruſt, or elſe are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and caſt back through the love of eaſe that we overcome not, as in the day of <hi>Midian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God ſends his ſpirit into tender &amp; ſoft hearts, but all things elſe are dry; &amp; then when the heart is refreshed and ſtrengthened, he ſends his bleſſing in all he takes in hand.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the ſign was, this year eat whatſoever groweth of it ſelf, and the next year <hi>without ſowing;</hi> So to us,</p>
            <p>He feeds us his own fulneſſe without any help of man or nature, and then enables man to be a husband in the Church of Chriſt: and this shal be like joy in harveſt-tide, Pſal. 33.</p>
            <p>Theſe battels were with noiſe &amp; tumbling in blood, but this by the feeling of Wrath and Indignation, which at laſt shall fall upon the power of Satan through the love of Chriſt, and conſume them: <hi>For unto us a child is born.</hi> Here is a Propheſie of Chriſt and his Kingdom and Government.</p>
            <p n="1">1 His Perſon is deſcribed unto us, with his Title and Office.</p>

            <p>Chriſt truely born to man, and living and ruling in the heart of man, and man ſubject to Chriſt, is the Food &amp; Fountain of all good, Wiſdom &amp; Happineſſe to man.</p>
            <p>He is the Seed of the Woman that breaks the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97089:115"/> head: He is our Wiſdom and Righteouſneſſe, and Peace and our Life: For all live through him, <hi>Paul</hi> through him was able to do all things, <hi>He is the way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> Joh. 14. <hi>If you abide in Me, and my Word abide in you, ask, and it shall be given you:</hi> Chriſt is that Word of Faith by which all things are eſtablished and made: He is the Light &amp; Life of Man: So that,</p>
            <p>When the miniſtry of the Word is formed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt, and that Word lives in man, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes he all that good and freedom promiſed in that Word.</p>
            <p>For look what Chriſt was, and did actually and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in the World, that he is, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th ſpiritually in the heart of man: He came by the will and promiſe of the Father, he was born, not of the will of the flesh: He wrought miracles to the believing man, ſo in us; gives ſight to the blind; He taught and made known the Will, Love, and Purpoſe of the Father to the World: So in us: He was ſubject to live in love, ſo in us. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m: &amp; the Life of Chriſt with the Father, the life of happineſſe: and the Death of Chriſt, the accomplishment of mans bleſſedneſſe and victorie.</p>
            <p>See then, how all the whole truth of God begins &amp; ends in one. That which was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> is Propheſied of: Here is born in time, and ſent to everie believer, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nay, we frame a Chriſt, and ſeem to worship him, but not given to us; nay, we have a conceit that he hath done all for us, but not born in us: we defend him, and plead for him, we diſpute of him, we talk of him, we read of him: but not born to us.</p>
            <p>This teacheth, that Chriſt was promiſed of God, and ſent in fulneſſe of time, and then his ſpirit ſent into the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>So there is a waiting for the promiſe under the Law: but in the fulneſſe of time he ſhal be born and given.</p>
            <p>For he came, when man was out of hope; for there was nothing but vexation under the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and then came a deliverer, and ſo to all men: When <hi>Sarah</hi> was paſt age, and without hope, then <hi>Iſaac</hi> is born.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A Son is born;</hi> Here is the promiſe of a <hi>Mesſiah,</hi> &amp; this already accomplished, both viſibly to the World, and ſpiritually to believers: So that,</p>

            <p>But moſt are not governed by Chriſt, but by their own Witt, Will, World and Flesh.</p>
            <p>Where then is the power of man, whereby he thinks to obtain Life? It remains in Chriſt, onlie enjoyed by Faith from day to day: elſe how doth Chriſt rule?</p>
            <p>But moſt will have the government upon their own shoulders: He rules all by the Word of Truth, Pſal. 45. <hi>His Scepter is a right Scepter,</hi> his Word returns not in vain, he bears up all by his mighty Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He shall be called wonderful.</hi> Here is his title and of admiration, and to be referred to all his Wonders in his Wiſdom and Counſel, in his Power, Love, &amp; Peace: So that,</p>
            <p>So the way of Chriſt in bringing man back from death to life, is a wonderful way unknown to the World and Flesh: only known by Chriſt in the Word of Truth, Iſa. 55.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>My wayes are not your wayes,</hi> but look how far it is a wonderful way, that he preſcribes in Matth. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To denie our ſelves, to take up his croſſe,</hi> loſe our life: It is called the myſtery of the Kingdom, for Geneſis 3. He ordained that man should never by that way of the flesh enter into life, but by another way that kills the flesh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way of Chriſt is oppoſite to the way of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97089:117"/> World, that his glorie may appear: For <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by want of Faith, ſtood in fear of the Armie of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> but <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer only diſcomfited by Faith, a wonderful power of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus God makes himſelf known in the earth by his great wonderful works: now Chriſts way is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, not only in his birth in earth without a Father, in Heaven without a Mother; but alſo in his miracles which were great: As in diſputing at twelve years old, and faſting fourtie dayes: but alſo in his miniſtry, that a ſilly man oppoſing the whole Hirarchie of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> yet ſpake with authority to the ſubduing of all, ſo in his Apoſtles for the wonderful evidence of the Truth, doth for the preſent, dash all contrary power, though afterward it riſe again: He is alſo wonderful in the adminiſtration of his Kingdom, as he came to give us light, that ſat in darkneſſe and obſcuritie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To give Life, and yet he dyed himſelf: and in Reaſon, was overcome in death, but that Faith believed the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make us Rich, and yet he himſelf Poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To make us free, and himſelf bound.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To comfort us, and yet he himſelf cryed out for comfort, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me;</hi> It muſt needs be ſome wonderful way that Chriſt hath to worke a Redemption for me, and this by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable power and love, which is ſeen in all mans ſtraits; as in prayer and affliction, temptation and death: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man cryes and prayes to be eaſed like <hi>Paul</hi> for a prick in the flesh, God hears by a ſecret power, and grace and ſaith in <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In affliction he layes Load, and yet preſerves by feeling the Fathers love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In temptations juſtifies, and yet we feel no killing of the flesh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Death comes, and yet we live in him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Away then with that reaſonable Religion, Chriſts way is above, that man hath a readie way of Religion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97089:118"/> to do well, and know much, and ſo hath an opinion in Flesh, but not a ſtay to the Soul: alſo, a reaſon of love, as his neighbour and friends, but no reaſon to love Enemies: It muſt be a wonderful power of Chriſt that muſt ſeparate man from himſelf in reaſon: it were likeſt that man should ſpeed beſt that comes righteous to him, but not ſo he that comes a ſinner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee then the neceſſitie of Faith and the nature of it, that it is not a reaſonable perſwaſion, but a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cleaving to Chriſt: &amp; no dealing with God but by Faith: for Reaſon can make nothing of the wayes of Chriſt.</p>

               </gap>rvel then not though the World cannot away with it, the Wiſdom of the World counts it foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but Faith knows that Reaſon is a foolish coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; this is another title and propertie, or declaration of the Wiſdom of the Father that was with him: he is the Counſeller, the Prophet of the Church, to teach it Wiſdom, and guide it in the way of peace.</p>
            <p>So that the Fountain of all wiſdom and counſel is in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and none wiſe in matter of Religion &amp; God, but they that are wiſe in, and truly know Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which are conveyed unto man as he believes &amp; waits for he is made of God to us wiſdom and righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any obey my will, he shall know, whether this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be of God?</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>For he was in the boſom of the Father, and ſent out to counſel and adviſe deceived men to turn to God again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Man is blind, even the wiſeſt of the World: &amp; the croſſe of Chriſt is their greateſt miſery: for it is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them; and they cannot approve it: but the World thinks not ſo: for, who are counted ſo wiſe as the children of this World, who fight againſt God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A ſmall thing is welcome to a poor man, when the rich deſpiſeth great gifts: now the poor man is naked, nothing to cover him: famished, nothing to fill his belly, as the Prodigal was, unable to help himſelf: and thence hopes for help.</p>
               <p>Rich and full hearts have no room for Chriſt, when man conceits of ſome quality in himſelf, and whereby he hopes. The cauſe why we are not helped is, becauſe we are not poor enough.</p>
               <p>See the bounty of God, who is ready to help the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the miſery of poor in the world that find no help, is, becauſe they ſeek it in the World.</p>

               <p>He that mourns and weeps in himſelf, and finds no comfort in himſelf, or the World; he reſts in God by Faith, but ſhal be comforted in Gods time.</p>

               <p>When thou haſt leſt expectation thereof, we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know that God loves us, thence believe, that he doth love us.</p>

               <p>Thus we ſee Chriſt is full of talking, believing men, and worldly knowledge: everie man full of opinions and high thoughts, but no love.

                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart.</hi> Theſe are oppoſed to the Hypocriſie of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which under shew of Religion, reſerved to themſelves rotten hearts and the World therein, which ſo muſled their mindes, that they ſaw nothing: Puritie is a metaphor taken from neatter mettal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which it not mingled with any filth, but clear from the Fountain: So we ſay, Pure water like gold, and that is ſeparated from all other things, and is ſimple: So that,</p>
               <p>Poor and ſimple minded men, who walk in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Religion, is bleſſed therein, James 3.1. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from above is, Firſt, pure, then peaceable, that is the ſeed in good ground, that is, good honeſt &amp; ſimple hearts, 1. Joh. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope purgeth himſelf as he is pure,</hi> for the heart joyned, or mixed with any other thing, mars it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was <hi>Adams</hi> ſimplicitie that is joyned to God onlie, which puritie is a mind cleaving to nothing but God only, and ſimple truth, like a wiſe to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, expecting nothing but what he is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Intention upright, though occaſion failing, there is a puritie Legal, and Evangelical, the one is in Rules, the other in Faith and Love; ſingling out the heart to Chriſt onlie: the heart is pure, when it is not mingled with its own deſires and luſts, and the pure Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth God without this or that, a pure love without condition, or end.</p>
               <p n="4">

               <p>But we deal not ſimply in any thing, but have ſelf-reſpects and ſeekings, ſeeking our ſelves: for we deal not ſimply in any thing. The pure heart then is he that ſees that iniquitie in himſelf; that he lothes himſelf: &amp; ſo is purged by the Laver of Regeneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They shall ſee God.</hi> This is not by curious comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion but by ſimple believing: that is, that God would ſhew himſelf in mercie, love &amp; wiſdom to them:</p>
               <p>So that, The poor and ſimple believing heart trulie underſtands the way of God, and ſees him in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and God reveals Secrets to them that fear him, and to none elſe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None hath ſeen God but he, none knows the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. <hi>In his light we shall ſee light, for ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and luſt blinds the moſt of all.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. <hi>He that thinks he knows ſomething, knows nothing at all: he that will become wiſe, muſt become a fool: God chooſeth fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If the mind cleave, or look at any thing elſe, it draws a vail that is ſees nothing. There are ſome that imagine a ſhape, and ſo ſeem to ſee blindly, attending in ſaith upon them: the light shines.</p>
               <p>Thus we are all full of knowledge and falſe light, but have not pure hearts: we muſt be wiſe, as Serpents and innocent as Doves. For, if man ſee God by Faith: he truſts, loves and fears, and is ſubject to him; all knowledge elſe, leaves a man whore he was, ſave this: it lifts him up againſt God.</p>
               <p>See the way how man is blinded, he hath a ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his own good, overruling, which ſets witts a working to find that good under the Sun. This bears off God, and ſo lights hold of Religion: and ſo ſtrains all his power to comprehend this God and good in him, and becomes a Maſter: and ſo rules and orders it, according as he thinks it may beſt make for his good not knowing what it is to receive freely, and live by Faith. Give me then a pure heart, and a ſimple believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97089:122"/> mind; for thats worth all knowledge: without this, all knowledge elſe leaves man, that he date not truſt, nor love that thing which he ſees: Yet, this is all that he hunts after, rather to know after the fleſh, than to believe by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers:</hi> Oppoſed againſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> buſie pride, and judging others: Yea, Chriſt could not be quiet in life for them: So that,</p>
               <p>Chriſts Religion is a peaceable Religion, and makes men peaceable, James 3. <hi>Wiſdom from above is pure &amp; peaceable.</hi> 1. For it pulls down pride.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſets man at work with himſelf, and none elſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It layes low the World, which ſets all at ſtrife: yet this quiets all.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Though not familiar, yet peaceable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is againſt that Religion, thats nothing but buſie quarrelling for victorie in this or that opinion; and that only in oppoſition to Church, ſtriving about Chriſts coat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe that are buſie with others, not themſelves: that ſtarts quarrels, and ſuits for trifles.</p>

            <p>THis Chapter declares Gods dealing with <hi>Saul,</hi> for his double dealing in the matter of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek:</hi> Theſe <hi>Amalekites</hi> were thoſe enemies which firſt withſtood the paſſage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> as they paſſed towards <hi>Canaan:</hi> againſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97089:123"/> whom, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> warred, who would have driven <hi>Iſrael</hi> back again into <hi>Egypt:</hi> againſt whom the Lord threatned that he would deſtroy them from off the earth, and have War with <hi>Amalek,</hi> from generation to generation, Exod. 17.14. To thoſe the Lord ſends <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy them: and he dealeth hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly therein, and for that is cut off. Further note, that theſe <hi>Amalakites</hi> were of the ſeed of <hi>Eſau:</hi> For <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi> was the Son of <hi>Elyphaz, Eſaus</hi> eldeſt Son, which he had by a concubine, Gen. 36. So that they were the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who were ſtill enemies to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here is <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtill, that is, the of ſpring of the flesh hated of God, hunting after the world: So that,</p>
            <p>Such and ſo are the corrupt will, &amp; fleshlie luſts of man: like theſe <hi>Amalekites:</hi> born of the flesh, hated of God, &amp; forſaken; hunting after the World, fighting againſt the ſpirit of man; heir of the Promiſe, &amp; hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the way towards the Lord of reſt. Nay, and when they were to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> they ſtopped the way; and after, when they were entred, they diſturbed <hi>Iſraels</hi> peace, as here: So that,</p>
            <p>Thoſe enemies muſt be ſubdued and routed out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man can have any reſt in the Land of the living, 1. Pet 2. <hi>Fight againſt the Soul.</hi> Gal 5. <hi>War againſt the ſpirit.</hi> Theſe have fleshlie reaſon for their kingly will, and affections for their Captains.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe like <hi>Amaleck,</hi> one while ſeeks comfort to the Flesh: cannot abide to want.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes to deny God through carnal reaſon; nay, in believers, when we should walk with God in aſſurance of Faith and ſubjection of love: then ſtarts up ſome fleshly power or other, either a man hath ſome worldly power to follow, or ſome fleshlie will to ſtick to: or quietneſſe, eaſe and peace to preſerve: or, ſomething that he dotes on, and follows not God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This shews that we have not reſt in our God only: becauſe the Sons of <hi>Eſau:</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> yet remain in our Land, and oppreſſe the way of God and of Chriſt:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97089:123"/> And why not peace in thy heart? becauſe the <hi>Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> yet live in thy heart, enemies with in thee: Thou ſighs without, with this want and that wrong, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie and diſtruſt, that do daily vex thee. For take away theſe, and reſt will come in all loſſes and croſſes. O that man would once war againſt himſelf to deſtroy theſe enemies! Thou art buſie againſt every body but thy ſelf, when thou should be againſt no body but thy ſelf, or elſe againſt ſomething elſe; as avoiding this or that: Nay, ſtay thy ſelf and take up theſe, and ſo shalt thou have peace; but theſe muſt be deſtroyed without any reſerving.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it firſt draw from the Covenant and Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it ſtrengthen thy own will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it make fleſh wanton, and ſo harden the heart, kill it.</p>
            <p>Nay, Chriſt will deſtroy that kingly reaſon, which will need fight againſt God and all his people: And that when God hath ſaid, <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall reſt: <hi>Amalekites</hi> ſaith no. So this turns the truth of God into a lye.</p>
            <p>We ſee then that the Church need not fear her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for God will roote them out of the earth, and have continual War with them that withſtand his Truth and Covenant: ſo that while thou ſticks to him thou art ſafe: nay, and he will warr with the ſeed of the Flesh in man. Doth he war againſt luſt, and will daily by his word? Nay, God is, and will be an enemy thereto; for the Law condemns it to death, and the Goſpel is the Executioner of the Law, and kills it in the heart of man: but if man will ſpare theſe, God will deſtroy man with them, for they muſt be deſtroyed, do thou what thou can to ſave them: for all Flesh is graſſe, and thou thinks to preſerve them, yet they muſt down, or elſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf muſt perish.</p>
            <p>But the power whereby thou ſeeſt, that is <hi>Moſes,</hi> praying and crying to God, gave them one blow; and then at laſt <hi>Joshua,</hi> even <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Captain of Faith, hewed them in pieces: So that the power is,</p>

            <p>When man hath juſtified himſelf, and hid himſelf in the depth of his own counſel, yet there remains in man a Legion of Rebellion, which hinders his peace, and which God will find out in the end: as to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Young Man, and the Rich Fool.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For mans pride ariſeth from ignorance in himſelf.</p>

            <p>O! that men would cleave to this Word of Truth in Spirit, it would either hew <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces, or elſe <hi>Saul</hi> should be cut off thereby.</p>
            <p>O! that we lived daily in the true underſtanding of our ſelves, this would deſtroy vain glory and pride: We think becauſe we have now a good motion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus moſt men deal with <hi>Saul,</hi> by halfs in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe they begin to look with Flesh at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that they have gotten, when thouſands are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, verſe 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have brought then from the Amalekits.</hi> Here <hi>Saul</hi> again excuſeth himſelf, and pleads their intent to offer Sacrifice, as afterward, verſe 21. So that,</p>
            <p>So thus in all men not mortified through Faith, would ſtill have both Joy and Faith, and a Will and Word of his own.</p>
            <p>So with <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo with <hi>Peter;</hi> He would have had caſe in the Flesh, and Chriſts companie too, ſo the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. ſee all unmortified.</p>
            <p>For, till by the power of God in the croſſe, the Flesh be ſubdued; it ſeeks to live as well as the ſpirit, &amp; ſave
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97089:126"/> it ſelf: For there is a ſelf-confidence, a wiſdom and a love: which would turn all to its own advantage, which indeed ſhould know or effect nothing at all, and ſo draws the mind after it.</p>
            <p>Thus, we dally with God in the way of Faith, by ſparing things that are profitable pleaſures.</p>
            <p>And thus man excuſeth this, or this: I do to follow the World that I may be better ſitted to ſerve God, &amp; to do good to others: and ſo it appears? that it is the end indeed: nay, thus we diſſemble with God: For when we ſay, We would live in freedom and joy: that in that joy we might better praiſe God our maker: but the end indeed, is for the good and eaſe of our ſelves, &amp; the fleſh eſpecially, in things that perfect our eaſe and peace: &amp; though the mind be thereby inſnared, we yet deal eaſily with it, and thus we ſtill reſerve our fat things, and deal favourably with them, and theſe are our greateſt enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Samuel ſaid, When thou waſt little in thine own eyes:</hi> This is Gods meſſage wherein he reckons up his favours to him: and ſecondly, his rebellion againſt thoſe: <hi>I raiſed thee up of nothing, why didſt thou fall on the prey as though I would not have rewarded thee?</hi> This Meſſage and Word was to convince <hi>Saul</hi> of his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: and,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſhews the door of mercie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way of Life; So that,</p>
            <p>The free grace of God is the fountain of life to man, and when man is vile and nothing in himſelf, then is the power of God moſt shown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that humbleth himſelf shall be exalted, He hath filled the hungry, and ſent the Rich emptie away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſo is man capable of grace, and the power of God is magnified in weakneſſe: What is it that ſtops thee free grace of God to man, that is that ſtrength and worth of man, that thinks he hath; for were man little enough, he would pray, cry, and believe, and fear: all miſchief enters in at the door of pride, or rather, this is the door that ſhuts our Chriſt: we ſtill muſe what we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97089:126"/> are, but not what God is: Then in this little and low condition to wait on God in the Word of Truth, and by Faith to walk in his power, ſhal deſtroy all enemies but when we fight with our power, and ſo cut &amp; carve to pleaſe the flesh, and when we depart from the Word of Truth, we never proſper: not that man by thinking baſely ſhall procure peace, but when ſimplie he is ſo: ſo God is, and will be with him, but mans perverſe way is, to turn from his God, and fall upon his prey.</p>
            <p>So that, the daily way of miſerie to man is his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and forſaking the way of Faith, and turning to the prey.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo <hi>David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> to his Revelations, ſo the Prodigal would have the prey; ſo <hi>Demas</hi> turned to the prey; nay, almoſt all have been caught in this ſnare:</p>
            <p>For ſuch is the force of ſenſual luſt &amp; imagination, that where God doth not mightilie preſerve, man ſtill turns hither.</p>
            <p>For the Word of Truth is the Life of man, which, while it lives in man it ſuffers nothing elſe to live in him: but when man turns from this, in comes a Legion of luſts and baſe affections, and imaginations, but this layes all low.</p>
            <p>Thus we fall on the prey of the World, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared all men, even believers themſelves, thus God bids flee the filthineſſe that's in the World through luſt, and promiſeth that he will be with us, but this we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and gather <hi>Mammon</hi> before hand, and fall on the prey, and this choaks all.</p>
            <p>So believers dots alſo on the libertie of the Goſpel, and turns it to wantonneſſe, &amp; turns to the prey; yea, whatever God doth to man, man turns to it, &amp; ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Faith is foreſaken.</p>
            <p>But ſee our ſafetie, God being our portion &amp; freedom &amp; his Word our Life; ſo shall we live for ever, verſe 20</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Saul ſaid, I have obeyed:</hi> Here is <hi>Sauls</hi> ſecond excuſe, wherein he defends himſelf, that he had done the Commandement of God, which indeed he had done in part; for he had killed many of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97089:127"/> 
               <hi>Amalekits,</hi> but yet with reſerving part of the Spoil to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſought honour of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Therefore he brought <hi>Agag</hi> alive, and ſlew him not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Riches, in ſparing the Cattel, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſacrifice: ſo it is with all double hearts in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: So that,</p>
            <p>Man by the light of the Law, ſhining into him; and working fear by the light of the Goſpel manifeſted, working freedom; may reſtrain and rectifie many things with a ſeeming obedience: yet ſtill with a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to himſelf: and ſome gain to be gotten, which mars all.</p>
            <p>As the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. Had done much, with a reſervation of falſe confidence Ezzra, 3.3. <hi>Their hearts ran after covetouſneſſe;</hi> ſo thoſe <hi>Libertines,</hi> 1. Pet. <hi>They promiſed libertie, they had great ſwelling Words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Satan is as a Saphira,</hi> Acts 5.</p>
            <p>For nothing goes through flesh but Faith in God, and the power of God in man, this purifies all: but fleſh would ſtill have ſomething, and that makes our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not ſimple.</p>
            <p>For man is ſeldom ſo ſeparate from himſelf in pure love unto God, but ſome ſelf-love there is, that is to his fleshly will ſticking to him, and purloyning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into his pouch to feed flesh with all.</p>
            <p>For mans natural power being enlightned by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Truth, diſcovering both the happineſſe of believers: and the miſerie of the reſt: doth produce in man an obedience according to his apprehenſion: and ſo far as the blind light workes upon him: but he never c mes to a real and actual denyal of himſelf: but there is a building up of his hope thereby: not to a ſimple heartie believing, and ſo living: but ſtill with a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of believing his own work and love of himſelf, and ſuch is the Religion of the moſt.</p>
            <p>We ſpare the King and far of the Flock: for there is a reſervation almoſt in all: For, when man would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97089:127"/> what a reſervation hangs on Righteouſneſſe, Reaſon &amp; ſelf-Conceit, ſo we believe God, but neither becauſe we are ſuch and ſuch.</p>
            <p>So there is a ſtop in our Faith: we ſtill have an eye to ſomething elſe in our Faith.</p>
            <p>And ſo for love, we love God, but with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſo much, becauſe, it is good in it ſelf, &amp; truly manifeſt to us: and that it is good to us, and ſo mans ſelf ſtill comes in, for want of mortification: For hardly do we any thing wherein we have not ſome reſpect to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And for the Word, we ſee Religion is the only way, and God the only good, but ſtill there ſticks in us a great lyking of the World: we hope for a good in it, &amp; find a marvelous ſweet therein.</p>
            <p>So that none hath any reaſon to be proud in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though he have obtained, and done that which many have not done, yet there is ſtill more that he knows not, loves not, does not; it may be thou haſt a little Faith, and now and then truſts God, but for the moſt part denies him, and truſts thy ſelf and arm of flesh, or truſts him for this, or that reaſon: ſo a little love to God, but a full love to the World, and thy ſelf. And here we ſee, that in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion two things poiſons all, <hi>viz.</hi> vain glorie, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved World: for, Firſt, we ſtill would have it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we limite all to this onlie, for we have ſo many reſervations for the World, as a care, time, love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet God is shut out of all; yea, after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods love, how freely do we return to the World again.</p>
            <p>Religion then is an abſolute yeelding our ſelves to God and his grace, without reſervation of thoughts: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Word brings all Sacrifice to nought, the Law given in Thunder to shake mans heart: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made freely, without any reſpect of mans Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that man may purely believe.</p>
            <p>Nay, and the power whereby all is accomplished is in God, not in man; that man, li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, brings man to fear and weakneſſe, before it bring him to Faith, and it keeps him in fear, that he may reſt in God.</p>
            <p>For man is grown proud and wiſe againſt God, elſe, he had never ſtood need of his Word; for it should have been a living Word in his heart for ever: as <hi>Paul, The weapons of our warfare are mighty, to bring down ſtrong holds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſee the very truth is perverted by man, for though <hi>Samuel</hi> come to beat <hi>Saul</hi> of his hold, yet he ſtill finds other ſhifts: l ke a wilie Fox: So men grow wiſe and cunning, and are liſted up thereby: yea, moſt yeeld fleshly obedience to this ſpiritual truth, and thereby becomes holie in conceit.</p>
            <p>Others conceiving gloriouſly of Chriſt, and thence grow high minded: for knowledge puffs up, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a man of high thoughts: but that man in whom the Word lives, and man by it keeps the eye inward towards himſelf, and keeps down all high thoughts in a quiet ſenſe of their own Weakneſſe and Vanitie, to attend with a crying and praying heart for mercie: which is ſweetly enjoy'd and not lifted up: but man freed and not hardened thereby: but out of feeling of himſelf, is pitiful towards all, judgeth none but himſelf.</p>
            <p>This ſhews the wonderful power of Gods truth that it will make <hi>Saul</hi> to bow, ſo of any man, even <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> for the preſent, though afterward they get up again: Now it is not Sacrifice that he looks for, but a believing loving heart: So that,</p>
            <p>All Service and Sacrifice that men ſeem to offer to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97089:129"/> God, not flowing from a loving heart, are nothing with him.</p>
            <p>Theſe are like the cutting off a dogs neck, Iſa. 1. <hi>Who required theſe things at thy hand?</hi> Pſal. 50 <hi>I reprove thee not, becauſe of thy Sacrifice, wherewith shall I appear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For he ſtands not need of thee, neither can he be moved by them, unleſſe we think as <hi>Balaam,</hi> with his ſeven Bollocks and Rams.</p>
            <p>Theſe are born of the flesh, Children of the bond Woman and not of God, nor by promiſe: Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is nothing, when we make it away to Faith, but when it is an expreſſion of a believing heart then it is ſweet.</p>
            <p>Now it is not Sacrifice that he condemns, but the curſed opinion that goes with it: Like that in the Law, a daily ſinging, a daily ſacrifice: ſo with us, when we do it with an evil intent, and not out of a ſimple mind.</p>
            <p>But we have one ſacrifice that is Chriſt only, who hath ſacrificed life and all, and that is it that pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with us alſo, our obedience is but to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to our God at <hi>Gilgall,</hi> that is, to purge ſin, and to pleaſe God: that we may get an opinion that God is well pleaſed for that: but this opinion ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This croſſeth the free ſacrifice of love; it is a great point of ſimplicitie in the hight of our obedience ſtill to be more vile, and this is the power of Faith, for it ſhews from whence we had it, not by our own power; Nay, when even in our own ſelves, we are oppoſit to God: he hath vouchſafed his grace.</p>
            <p>The only ſacrifice of God is a broken and contrite heart, ſacrifice thy ſelf, and it is in ſtead of all thy luſts, deſires, caſe, peace, life and all; and when thou haſt done that, thou ſhall have, as Chriſt, had victory over all; a Reſurrection, a Freedom and a Glory: and ſo ſhall ſit at Chriſts right hand by Faith till all be ſubdued
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97089:129"/> to thee, and then man offers ſacrifice of praiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his name, not to purge ſin, but in expreſſion of Gods love and manifeſtation, and that in love and mercie and not in ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice;</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>That which is accepted, is an obedient heart, ſubject to the Fathers will in love, is the Life of all Religion, and better then a thouſand Sacrifices, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God opened mine ear, and I was not diſobedient, and Samuel ſaid, Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth,</hi> Chriſt yeelded himſelf to the Father: Alſo <hi>David, the will of the Lord be done,</hi> and Chriſt to the <hi>Phariſees, Ye tithe mint, anniſe and cummin</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Pſal. 8. <hi>If my people had hearkened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God is the ſole Lord over all, and man a ſilly creature, and as the life of a ſubject is in obedience to a Prince, ſo here, is mans happineſſe in yeelding to Gods will; for that muſt ſtand whether man be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or not, for diſobedience was that which caſt off <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that is, becauſe man will needs be God.</p>
            <p>Now obedience is two-fold, of Faith and Love. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Faith is, when the clear evidence of the Truth of the Promiſe, and mans Reaſon and Wiſdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eelds to that Truth: as <hi>Moſes</hi> at the Red-Sea, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> When man ſees no reaſon in himſelf, that God ſhould or will keep promiſe, but the contrary, he ſeeing nothing but rebellion and iniquitie, &amp; yet ſtick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to that, where all reaſonable wayes of the World, and all threats of Satan are overcome, though the World threaten want: yet he believes fulneſſe, <hi>for this is the will of God that ye believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But moſt believe not, but rebell in this, for though God hath promiſed, yet we obey not, believe not, but give the promiſe the lye: and ſay, That God will not do, and therefore fear.</p>
            <p>So that infidelitie is the great Rebel that ſtrikes at the Truth of God, which a man cannot endure.</p>
            <p>This Faith alſo mars not obedience, in neither limiting
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97089:130"/> God a time but waiting: nor a meaſure, but believing that it shall be our reſt. Obedience of love is the end of the Law, where the love of Chriſt enforceth man: and this is a ſweet and free yeelding up of a mans life unto God, as a Sacrifice, Rom. 12. Which cannot be till our bodies and flesh be ſacrificed. and then in the Spirit of our minds we are revived according to the will of God</p>
            <p>This is not to be a foundation of Faith, but a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary expreſſion of the love and goodneſſe of God to man: This flows from Faith naturally, there is nothing but rebellion and luſt, if Faith fail to wait on God: God doth this obedience, and man fleeth, and man ſeeketh shifts, or ſome device.</p>
            <p>The intent is, doing what he commands not, becauſe the Law forceth ſo many thievish hearts are bound to be true, but not from the heart.</p>
            <p>And warms of Gods love in the heart to ſuffer for his ſake, what ever befalls, as the Martyrs did: but this ſhews the little obedience in man: For indeed neither will ye yeeld, but the old contention remains, whether shall be God: Faith and Love is the obedience &amp; life of man, and when man lives in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> yeelding temper, nothing can vexe him: let imposſibility come, and he is obedient and ſuffers: And ſo was Chriſt, obedient unto the death of the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>But, while man hath a will and love of himſelf, he is never freely obedient, but would frame Gods will to his: and to hearken to Satans voice raither than Gods: So that,</p>
            <p>An open ear to hear, and a heart to believe and obey the voice of God, and the Word of Truth, is better than all ſeeming ſacrifice a man can offer, Iſa. 45. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ears, &amp;c.</hi> Then shall ye hear the voice of God, and he that hears, shall live: <hi>He opened mine ear, and I was not diſobedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So to that end, God hath given his Word to man, that thereby he might be called back again to God: <hi>Therefore God ſaith, cry aloud to man, and bid him return and come and live for ever, and ſo he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>

            <p>VVHen God had governed <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Judges for many years, and manifeſted his power and truth by his Prieſts and Prophets, in bringing them into the Land of Promiſe, according to the Covenant; and given them many victories o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their enemies. <hi>Iſrael</hi> grew ſecure and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, yea, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt himſelf grew ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the Lords ſacrifice: yea, even <hi>Ely</hi> himſelf, committed them into the hands of his Sons, who filled their bellies and luſts, and that without reproof: Whereupon the Lord intended to deſtroy that vain confidence, and to proceed againſt the houſe of <hi>Ely,</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:97089:131"/> which he fore-tells in the ſecond Chapter, by a man of God; and in the third, by <hi>Samuel,</hi> which in the fourth Chapter, he brings to paſſe. Firſt, by giving <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the hands of their enemies once again, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the Ark into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ely</hi> and his two ſons.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Iſrael</hi> had received the overthrow at the hands of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> they make way for a ſecond, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning further from God; So that,</p>
            <p>This is the way of man, for man by every affliction is either brought nearer to God, or elſe driven farther from him, and ſo makes way for greater evils to befall him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>David,</hi> who to hide his ſhame, ran into murther: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> having ſinned to hide his shame, hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from God; ſo <hi>Saul</hi> to the Witch of <hi>Endor;</hi> like a child that grows more cunning, after the whip, more w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many things light upon man that touch not his heart but is ſo blinded with luſt and ſelf-love; that the light of the truth leads him not out, but his wit will needs guide him; God doth nothing in vain</p>
            <p>If man regard not Proceſſe, or any hatchment that is coming, he shall ſee that a writ of Rebellion is coming: and if he regard not that, than a Bailiff comes, and to priſon he muſt: and that God by the righteouſneſſe of the Law may bring down mans high heart, that he may depend on mercy.</p>
            <p>Thus man grows more vile after a judgement to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, but no more yielding and obedient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Shall God be ſtill mocked, to ſee that nothing doth man good, till his heart be brought down and flee all, that he may reſt in God? For he hath as much to do, to bring down thy wit, as thy will, and to deſtroy thy carnal confidence, and draw thee from thy object. All miſery come in at the door, that is by fleeing from God.</p>
            <p>Yea, thus doth God deal with his people &amp; children, he delivers them into the hand of their enemies: and then they think to worke it out: and ſtill God makes their works void; then they ſeek to know all, and he makes that void, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuffers nought to proſper, till man reſt in Faith.</p>

            <p>By this, Satan beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and thought to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Chriſt to argue the Fathers love by Wiſdom, that is not ſubject to the Law of God, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>Gideon, Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> overcame with a few, contrary to all reaſon: When they eyed reaſon only, then <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour and <hi>Davids</hi> one hundred and fifty thouſand could not prevail.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For God hides his wayes from the wit of man, and <hi>reveals it to Babes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Satan lurks here to oppoſe the way of Faith, God hath revealed his Wiſdom: but hereby Man becomes wiſe againſt God, and gives him the lye.</p>
            <p>Thus man deviſeth a device againſt God, and thinks thereby to thrive: and Satan thereby befools man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding unto him a likely way, great power and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, that he may fix thereon; and yet hath not God in the very eyes of the World fruſtrated their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: as when thou haſt great Riches, Land, Wiſdom, Friends, and what not, had built him an neſt that he might never want: yet, he had never good dayes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: but either he hath ſpent all to beggerie, or a ſlave to it while he hath it: or a languishing of ſickneſſe: had not Gods fooliſh way of faith been better.</p>
            <p>Thus Satan caſts a miſt before the eye of Faith when he would bring God &amp; his way within compaſſe of mans witt.</p>
            <p>Now in the Church, we grow wiſe to comprehend the very purpoſe of God, &amp; give a reaſon of his will, &amp; ſet a law to his juſtice: &amp; faine a reaſonable way of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; his free will &amp; the foreſeeing of Faith: God chooſe man: but it is ſo reaſonable a Doctrine, it cannot prove true: for Gods truth was ever foolishneſſe to wiſe men.</p>
            <p>See the difference of Gods way and mans witt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The one is alwayes dark and uncertain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ſure, the one forſakes God &amp; his Word, the other cleaves to it; The one ſeems well and ends ill, the other contrary.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:97089:133"/>
            <p>The ſafe way of man is not to truſt the device of man, for thou haſt ſeen theſe fail thee; nay, when they ſeem likeſt the other quiet contrarie, therefore never diſpute how like or unlike, but lay down all &amp; believe.</p>
            <p>Hadſt thou no Luſt, nor Will, nor Witt to truſt to: then had Satan no power againſt thee: For either thy Witt, or thy Will draws thee, on thy Will, when thou art not ſubject in patience: thy Witt, when thou wilt do Gods Work, thine own way is here.</p>
            <p>They would fight Gods battels, but would not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on him at <hi>Shilo, his own place.</hi> But would draw him from thence to them, ſo we would have God with not but not wait on him: we would have the promiſe fulfilled, but not wait the time; So that,</p>
            <p>The ſure way is to wait on God in his way, though we ſee no way out of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> abode in <hi>Canaan</hi> as a ſtranger, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> at Jordan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the viſion is for an appointed time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus man workes his own woe, when he either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a way of his own, and will not ſtay: or joyns fleshly Wiſdom, for the furtherance of Gods will; or impatience of delay, appoints a time: Take heed of preſerving any thing before God, and his Work and Promiſe. Many are never well, unleſſe the Father be ſtill playing with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it may ſave us.</hi> Here is ſelf-confidence, not that they thought the Ark could ſave them: but becauſe if they had the Ark with them, God would ſave them: This is not ſimple believing, but with relation to ſomething elſe than God; So that,</p>
            <p>Such is carnall confidence in man, it is a ſnare of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an wherein he intangles men to draw the heart to look at ſome Work or Gift of God, and ſo to believe, becauſe of that; and not for his ſimple truth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>So <hi>David</hi> thought, that becauſe of the thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he should preſerve himſelf; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aarons</hi> time, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, O Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 30.

               <hi>Thou haſt made my Mountain ſtrong, it shall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The Phariſees they were righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this is to build a houſe on the ſand, for there is no cauſe that moves God to do good, or man to believe God, but his ſimple Word and Truth, though God ſhine and manifeſt himſelf in all things; yet when the Soul is turned from God to them, they become ſnares, as the braſen Serpent, for the mind muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reſt on.</p>
            <p>So that, when God is wanting, Satan the God of this World brings in the fulneſſe of the World, and the certainty thereof, and preſents them to man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Fulneſſe of Riches and Friends will ſupplie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Self-righteouſneſſe, and many luſts and failings of love; ſaying, They will preſerve thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or, a carnal beholding of Chriſt, as here to the Ark</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, believers are thus drawn, when Chriſt lives not in them, they ſuffer with him: but in all there is a bottom darkneſſe, and fear of hardneſſe and ſelf-pride.</p>
            <p>Here, Satan layes the foundation of all iniquities; for why doth man covet, oppreſſe, deceive; but that the World may be his ſtay, and his confidence? as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either a blind ſecuritie, from little medling; or, a blind preſumption, becauſe he hath this or that more than others: &amp; yet no more certain, nor better ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Thus, the blind World is deceived: everie man ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind, by looking at ſomething that he hath, or labours to get, ſomething that he hath not; that it may ſave him, as the rich fool; nay, were it for thy riches and friends, where were thy believing.</p>
            <p>Thus, all things become ſnares, when the mind is fixed on them, and man tyes God to them: which is not a believing of God, but of that portion.</p>
            <p>We ſhould worke Righteouſneſſe, but not look at that Righteouſneſſe, attend on the Ark, but believe not in it, but rejoyce in it with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> might uſe all creatures, but not ſee a good in them, it is a great point of ſimplicitie to enjoy all, and not to depend on it; but rejoyce in it with God, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97089:134"/> thereby to ſee the Fountain from whence it flowed, and the weakneſſe of man: Nay, ſuch is the deceit thereof, that it lifts man up above him ſelf; man shouts before the victorie. But there will come a day of mourning to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this Ark and Riches shall be taken away:</p>

            <p>THus we ſee the fall of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for truſting in their inventions, and forſaking the power and truth of God. The Ark is now taken from them, and <hi>Hophnie</hi> and <hi>Phinias</hi> the Prieſts alſo: and now they are leſt deſolate, for <hi>Eli</hi> is now dead, according to the Word of the Lord, which we ſee muſt ſtand: So that,</p>
            <p>No power or device of man ſhall be able to diſſannul, or make void the Word of God: but it ſhall ſtand &amp; be accomplished both to believers, &amp; againſt the wicked, though man fight againſt it, and ſeek to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>He hath ſpoken, and ſhall he not perform it: Yea, <hi>Heaven and Earth shall paſſe away, but his Word shall not paſſe:</hi> He hath ſaid, That <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall be cut off, all the World cannot uphold him: He hath promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> nothing shall hinder: neither four hundred and thirtie years time: nor the power of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor difficulties in the Wilderneſſe; nor fourtie Kings in <hi>Canaan:</hi> Hath he ſaid, That <hi>Mesſiah</hi> shal come, he shal be born in the fulneſſe of time? Hath he ſaid He wil preſerve <hi>David:</hi> all the power of <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Goliah</hi> shall not kill him? Hath he promiſed Life to believers, then though Satan rebel and rage, yet the promiſe shall be <hi>Yea,</hi> &amp; <hi>Amen?</hi> For he is not man, that he should lie God shall juſtifie his righteous judgements, that he hath done nothing to man, but he hath told it to man before.</p>
            <p>Hereby appears the puritie of Faith, and power of God, under the croſſe: that though man think to shift it, yet judgement shall come: And though man ſee no Reaſon, nor help, yet abiding by the Word of God: he

            <p>But man fights againſt this, and rather ſtrives to make the Truth of God a lie, than to yeeld and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; God hath ſaid, He will deſtroy that man, that runs on in wickedneſſe: and that the wicked, that forget God shall be turned into hell: and yet theſe men believe it not, but make God a lyer, as the Serpent did to <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Others think they ſhall deviſe ſome way hereafter to eſcape: they take any courſe, rather than believe him: and yet we have ſeen it with our eyes: Did he not ſay, He would cut off <hi>Saul,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> caſt off the <hi>Jews,</hi> and call in the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Remove his Candl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, hath he not ſaid, <hi>That the drunkard shall come to povertie, and shame:</hi> and doth he not ſay, <hi>That the uſerers and oppreſſors shall not proſper to the third generation, and that the generation of the juſt shall be bleſſed,</hi> &amp; do we not ſee it well.</p>
            <p>Know then, though thou make a mock of it, &amp; of us poor ſilly flesh, as thou art: and caſt it off, and thinks to eſcape: Yet be ſure; it will meet with thee, He should not be a God of truth if thou perish not, holding on thy courſe: but thou wilt reply, Doth he not ſay alſo, That this brings a heart that cannot repent, and thou more unpat than before?

            <p>Nay, how often doth believers ſtart from this, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve rather their own devices than God, hath he not ſaid: That nothing but Faith and Love avails: &amp; yet we

            <p>
               <hi>The Philiſtins took the Ark of God.</hi> The fear of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was upon all Nations, as upon the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> here in theſe Words. 1. <hi>The Philiſtins taking the Ark &amp; carreing it to Ashdod,</hi> one of their chief Cities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their ſetting it up by Dagon their God, the fall of Dagon at the preſence of the Ark.</p>
            <p n="3">3, Their repairing and ſetting up again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſecond fall, with the loſſe of his head and hands.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Ark was taken away, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> was grown ſecure, becauſe of <hi>Samuels</hi> words. The Ark, and <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, they were proud, and fat in their own conceit: and ſo had turned Faith into a blind preſumption, and ſecuritie: therefore, it was taken away: So that,</p>
            <p>When Man by reaſon of any gift, or priviledges: grows proud and ſecure in himſelf: not ſenſible of his own weakneſſe and power; and the promiſe of God: this is the way to loſe it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> was lifted up in his high mountain, he was ſoon brought low: and when <hi>Paul</hi> was lifted up
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97089:135"/> in aboundance: he had a prick in the flesh: When <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a Covenant with death, God diſannul'd it. If <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> be lifted up, upon his Babels he muſt be brought down amongſt the Beaſts: The <hi>Jews</hi> being a people alwayes boaſting, they came to be no people.</p>
            <p n="1">1 So thus we forſake God, and cleave to the creature</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby ſimplicitie of believing is loſt, &amp; changed into vain and fleshly confidence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is the way to purge the old heart, and to bring in the heart to God, or elſe would man never return to him; if he should proſper.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nothing more oppoſit to the grace of God, than the pride of man: This was the ſin of the Angels, being ſo proud, and doting upon their own excellencies, they deſpiſed God in whom they should have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>And yet this is the ſnare we all fall into: we enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the mind is fixed on it, and grows proud of it, and imagines our ſelves to be ſtrong and ſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it: when it is only in the hand of God to be given, and taken at his will, and pleaſure, all gifts are to be rejoyced in, but not to be proud of; while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce only, the mind is kept humble: ſeeing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and feeling his weakneſſe: but pride hardens and makes ſecure.</p>
            <p>Nay, what gift is it we look not at, and think our ſelves the better for it: and that our Faith and Hope is nourished by theſe as much as Gods truth and love is enjoyed: Hath not the rich man more confidence, that he ſhall not want than the poor man? hath not the righteous man more confidence, his ſtate is good, than the deſolate wretch? and yet his righteouſneſſe, as his own, brings no ground to believe, but only Gods free grace.</p>
            <p>Is this any thing but Pride and Securitie? &amp; making the arm of fleſh his ſtay: Yea, thus are believers drawn: take we heed, that this be not the way for our Land to loſe all: we shall bragg of our peace, till we loſe it, and of our pride, till we be ſubdued: yea, of our
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97089:136"/> wealth till we have loſt all: yea, of the Goſpel, till it be taken from us, as here they did the Ark.</p>
            <p>But it is Gods goodneſſe to croſſe all his, in that wherein they are miſled; that man may ſee what a weak creature he is, and what a weak ſtaff he hath truſted to, as the World, and now is gone; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and now as he had neither known God, nor himſelf.</p>
            <p>But know, there will come a parting day from thy deareſt object; thy careful Father, tender Mother, deareſt Infants, loving Brother &amp; Siſter: &amp; all, becauſe thou dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No joyning of the Ark and Dagon in our houſe, nor God and Mammon in our heart: nor fleshly Wit, nor Gods Truth cannot ſute together in Gods Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve two maſters, God and Mammon, Chriſt and Bellial:</hi> Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt, if God, be God, ſerve him, Rom. 5.6. <hi>Know you not to whom ye give your ſelves Servants: his Servants you are. This is putting new wine into old bottels:</hi> Chriſt gives the Reaſon, <hi>either he will love the one and hate the other: or elſe forſake the one and ſtick to the other:</hi> The Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend two objects at once.</p>
            <p>For, look what reſpect we have to the one, it draws from the other, God is a ſpirit, and muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, truſted and loved with the ſpirit of our minds; elſe no communion with him.</p>
            <p>For as a man hath a Garment, a Bodie and a Soul: So Religion, the garment is the outward form of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97089:136"/> Actions, Righteouſneſs, Holineſſe, the body is Truth: Righteouſneſſe revealed to the Church, apprehended by man, but the Soul of it is the Spirit, even God himſelf: as the Garment and Body without the Soul, are but dead Corps, and ſo this without God: So <hi>Paul</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished man, into Soul, Body and Spirit: by the Body, the outward Maſſe of flesh: the Soul, the vital power and ſenſitive appetites, and natural underſtanding: by the Spirit, the immortal, or inward part, in right diſpoſing of which, ſtands mans peace and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>For if the Bodie be in health, and the Soul in Life amidſt the fulneſſe of its natural objects: yet no reſt, unleſſe the Spirit be ſatisfied alſo: now when the Spirit of our minds is drawn by ſenſual power to bodily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it wants Life: But leaving all theſe, being guided to, and joyned to God and Chriſt, it is then ſatisfied: and the body cannot be nouriſhed with the pleaſure of the Soul without food, nor the Soul with the food of the Body without its objects: neither can the Spirit without them both, without its proper objects &amp; food.</p>
            <p>So that the confounding of theſe is the confuſion, &amp; unreſt of the Soul.</p>
            <p>And yet alace! it is thus in the World: men will needs joyn God and Dagon; Chriſt and Mammon, without any truſt, or thought of God at all, like beaſts: Others keep a form of God after the flesh: as they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his power, and ſee his juſtice, &amp; fear &amp; worſhip him, with a far off worship: but the heart bowes to Mammon, loves and cleaves to him above all.</p>
            <p>Nay, believers joyn theſe together, ſome put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, but more in the World; yea, how ſoon after God hath shewed himſelf to man by his truth and love; doth he joyn heart and hands with the World again? So that indeed this eats out all Religion amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And for fleshly Wiſdom, how doth this draw from ſimple believing, &amp; asking a reaſon, diſputing with him: &amp; joyning the power of man &amp; the power of God: &amp; ſo making mans free-will a worker with God: So that it is, that man believes not God.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:97089:137"/>
            <p>True it is, that man is the ſubject in whom God workes, yet the life and power of believing &amp; working is in God, and given to man by Faith according to the Promiſe: and though <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>They are workers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> yet it is in regard of manifeſtation, not of any power they had over the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>Nay, let this God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be our only ſtay, and lay <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour aſide: ſo man abiding in his ſimple and naked heart, full of weakneſſe, like a Child, waiting on Gods ſimple truth, the Father will come: but when man thinks to help God, he mars all.</p>
            <p>Neither is this a way to ſecuritie, but onlie unto thoſe that pervert all truth unto their own deſtruction: For this is not a ſecure reſting at all adventures, as though the forlorn child could ſit down at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſay, It cannot help my ſelf, my Father muſt come or I muſt be loſt, but not ſenſible of his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and forlorn eſtate: As the Prodigal ſeeks, and cryes, and prayes, till he come: this keeps him fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that, Religion is a ſimple thing and cannot mix it ſelf with any thing, like the Truth, that joynes to none till death: but ſimply waits on God with Faith and Love.</p>
            <p>But when man brings in Dagon, and ſets him up: the Soul of man abhors it: or is joyned to it, or is deceived: Then no bringing in of Religion into a fleſhly mind but firſt, Dagon muſt down: then Religion will ſtand.</p>
            <p>If ever it be offered to a Worldly mind, it is not an unwelcome gueſſe, for the Life of that Soul is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: It is in the World and pleaſures thereof: but the Spirit is dead within them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dagon was fallen,</hi> Thus the power of God deſtroyes the Idol; So that,</p>
            <p>Thus the Truth of God prevails againſt the Idol, and will not ſuffer any thing to ſtand equal with God in mans heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> deſtroyed circumciſion from Chriſt, and Chriſt &amp; the young man, his weapons taken from him, his high thoughts pulled down.</p>
            <pb n="261" facs="tcp:97089:137"/>
            <p>And thus Gods warriours pulls down groves, and deſtroyes Idols.</p>
            <p>That God may thereby let man ſee the weakneſſe of all power in the creatures. This is the proper work of the Word to pull down high imaginations, and lay them low as the valyes: This truth diſcovers the vanitie of all the reſt: but we, with the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> are ſtill building up Dagon: nay, the Ark is not yet come to us, becauſe Dagon is yet ſtanding.</p>
            <p>But know, that it muſt down: So that mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in the fall of the fleſh, and all the power thereof.</p>

            <p>CHriſt by his death, hath brough life; this death was ſpoken of by the Prophets, and often foretold by Chriſt: and ſpoken of more at large, and now is come by ſuffering to loſe all: that he may gain all: after that he had comforted His Diſciples, and left them the pledge of his Love: he Propheſies of the trouble that ſhall come to them hereby: that they may now begin to ſuffer with him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Grievous wants and perſecutions to the offending of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That man ſhall not ſtand at that day by any power at all in man.</p>
            <p>In the ſame he lets them ſee, that this is the way they muſt ſtill follow.</p>
            <p>This is a ſacrifice of his death, whereby the ſame through Faith is confirmed to us: He shews what ſhal become of the head; and that they ſhould be offended: So that,</p>
            <p>Though we live in the light of the Goſpel, and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of Gods bleſſing: yet there will come a day that will dash all, and lay it in the duſt.</p>
            <p>So to <hi>David, Abraham,</hi> and the Rich Fool.</p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:97089:138"/>
            <p>For life gotten by the creature muſt be laid away; Chriſt is the common ſtock of believers.</p>
            <p>Woe to the World, for all high mountains muſt down, thy deareſt object and thou muſt part: When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was boaſting of the Temple, then was the Lord removing it from <hi>Shilo,</hi> or deſtroying: <hi>that new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem might come from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See how thou wilt do, when this night comes, we provide light, fire and houſes, againſt cold and night: but forget this night.</p>
            <p>Let believers look for it in their greateſt fulneſſe and proſperitie, for then will God take away theſe, that he may be perfected in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will ſmite the shepherd:</hi> Yea, Chriſt in the flesh, that he may reſt ſolely and ſimply in God. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Prodigal. <hi>Paul, I know none after the flesh, by taking away fuel from it:</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>This is the way to bring man to God, to purifie Faith, to ſubdue the World, and make Gods power known. This he doth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that great tribulation that lyes all on heaps.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By his love that kills all at the heart, but then we grow wiſe in the flesh, to ſeparate the confuſed heap.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the croſſe that wears out all the flesh alſo.</p>
            <p>Woe to them that have none other ſtay, how will they do, when their Shepherd shall be ſmitten, like an Orphant, when the Father is dead?</p>
            <p>See the vanitie of man, that would ſtill have ſome hold in the flesh.</p>
            <p>But herein doth God bleſſe his people, when by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his truth, he deſtroyes all imaginations: &amp; by the croſſe, deſtroyes all luſt: and leaves man nothing, but God and his Truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The freedom and happineſs of man in knowing &amp; ſavouring nothing after the flesh, Rom. 8. <hi>This is not to walk after the flesh but after the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that which man thus knows, he knows not: and that which he loves not, thus he luſts after; for thus to know God, or to love him, is not to know
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97089:138"/> him: but to know, will, and love all things in God, is to know him indeed: for that man which knows in the flesh, it is not of God, but his own imaginations.</p>
            <p>And there will come a ſcattering day to all fleshlie imaginations, as to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when knowledge shall vanish, and mans fleshly hopes shall be deſtroyed: Where then will man appear? Thy Husband, thy Child, thy Idol, thy Portion, thy Idea, thy Shapes of Fancy, all shall vanish; yea, thy shepherd too, and nothing left, but God and his Truth: Where then will thy fleshly heart reſt? So that,</p>
            <p>To believe and truſt, when all is ſcattered, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſimply:</p>
            <p>For to believe, when all is joy and peace, is rather to believe after the flesh, and becauſe of them; which is a turning from God, to his gifts, and then we loſſe them: but to believe, when we are killed, as <hi>Job,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: this is to believe God in and from God, and to love in and from him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Though all forſake thee,</hi> &amp;c. Here is <hi>Piters</hi> blind confidence, wherein, note this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of his; though others shall, yet not he; So that,</p>
            <p>Pride of heart advancing it ſelf above others, out of a ſelf conceit of ſome ſingular gift or power, is the ready way to a fearfull fall below all.</p>
            <p>As Proverbs, <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction,</hi> Luk 18. The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> So <hi>Iſrael,</hi> So <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> The <hi>Jews, Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this is a turning away from God, &amp; becoming a God to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe conceits ariſe from the devil, and ſets God at nought, deſtroyes Faith, and ſets up mans fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits like a Queen.</p>
            <p>Theſe have been the ground of all factions in the Church.</p>
            <p>God will leave this man free to himſelf, and others that dote upon him.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that man is a proud creature, he gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97089:139"/> but he is lifted up by it: nay, moſt labour for abundance, not for neceſſitie: ſo much as they may excel.</p>
            <p>This conceit ſticks faſt in all, ariſing from blindneſſe in regard of our fulneſſe: for thou mayſt ſee the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of all men in thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>But faithful men fear and diſtruſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hemſelves above all, relying on God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forſake thee. Peter</hi> had a blind confidence, not knowing the weakneſſe of man: So that,</p>
            <p>Man that is preſumptuous and bold through fleshly confidence, and his ſelf-power ſhall never ſtand nor proſper.</p>
            <p>There, this is <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 30. and <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> but <hi>Davids</hi> boaſting elſe-where was in God only, <hi>through God, we shall do great things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For mans ſtanding &amp; preſervation is not of himſelf.</p>
            <p>This is a ſandy foundation, for as it was but fleſh, ſo it boaſted: So, when the foundation was removed, the flesh feared.</p>
            <p>Thus man walks preſumptuouſly in all things thinking; I will do this or that, when often he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and yet will not ſee it.</p>
            <p>But that man walks ſafely, that walks in fear: for he truſts none but God, and as he fears, ſo he believes: Faith in God makes man humble in himſelf.</p>
            <p>No ſurer ſign of a fall in believers: than when they begin to boaſt: nay, this man denied above all; So that,</p>
            <p>How far a man is lifted up in any thing, ſo far he muſt fall.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For here we have no habitation, but like Pilgrims in tents.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For God hath ſent us hither a while, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his Will according to his Word: but our abiding hereafter is eternal, not to build a reſt here: or, think our houſes ſhall continue; but to wait on his coming: when we ſhall have the reward and doom, that laſteth for ever.</p>
            <p>We ſee it in all faithful Servants, how careful they are to have all in a readineſſe, when the Maſter comes home: and the Maid, how doth ſhe ſweep, and waſh, and ſcoure, that her Maſtres may find all right: but the careleſſe, they ſport and ravel, and ſpend and waſte on their Luſts: and when they have done, lye down and ſleep, and ſay, Nay, the Maſter will be long before he come.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And thus it fareth with the ſecure World, we watch all opportunities but this: When a man hath a great buſineſſe to do, O! how he muſeth, and thinketh, and ſtudieth night and day; be it ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And is not here a great account to make? nay, how do we watch for a fair day in harveſt, and ply our time: and yet this great buſineſſe we heed not?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, nothing ill make us wait on God, but the Croſſe: as to the Diſciples, Do we watch to get out of the World: or rather, to run farther into it: As it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> ſo now, nay worſe: For now the World is drowned in careleſneſs, witneſs, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive drinkings, and endleſſe drunkenneſſe; our too common trade of uſerie, and oppreſſion; our neglect of

Will not the Lord of the Church call for a reckoning for theſe: and if we be taken in theſe, woe unto us? We know what is the hire of ſuch faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Servants. We watch the plague to prevent death, but we wait not on God to meet death: we watch the enemies of our Land, that we be not ſurprized: but we have an enemie within, that will overthrow us: We provide againſt famine, and yet our ſelves pine.</p>
            <p>Now this watching is not any power in man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf, but ſenſible of his own weakneſſe to preſerve himſelf, and longing to be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we wait in Faith upon the Word of Chriſt, believing the promiſe, though we ſee nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie; and death, yet expecting life and freedom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we be working in love, and obedient to his Will, not ſeeking, or ſerving our own Luſts: even ſo, as we would have Chriſt to finde us, when he comes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Truely knowing our own danger, &amp; the ſtrength of the Devil, and the World over us, daily drawing us to forget this day.</p>
            <p>That which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>come,</hi> is, or should be the care of all our Watch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If our love were to Chriſt, would we not wait for him as the Wife for her Husband, and the Child for the Father?</p>

               <l>True Eloquence I blame not, but ſuch froth,</l>
               <l>As all in ſounds out from the ſpeaker goeth:</l>

               <l>True Eloquence is in its ſplendor, where</l>
               <l>Fullneſſe of matter, words doth overbear:</l>
               <l>Setting the heart of ſuch a large extent,</l>
               <l>Like a full Veſſel that muſt needs have vent:</l>
               <l>Or well-charg'd Piece, whoſe bullet fircely drives,</l>

               <l>The chief intention which one hath in hand,</l>
               <l>Being how to make his hearer underſtand,</l>

               <l>A cauſe why ſuch whoſe heart and tongue agree,</l>

               <l>What uſe hath eloquence, but to impart,</l>
               <l>To other men, the language of the heart:</l>
               <l>Wherein the plaineſt words that wit can finde,</l>

               <l>(Though moſt men think its but too much ado)</l>
               <l>And plain, another thing than words high born,</l>
               <l>Where wind inſtead of Subſtance doth adorn:</l>

               <l>Ne're pierce means hearts, but ſets the wits at gaze:</l>
               <l>The Preacher's, like the neat ſpruſe Citie Dame,</l>
               <l>Who, when an hungred from a feaſt she came,</l>
               <l>And asked by her Maid (and therewith chidden)</l>
               <l>Why ſhe eat not with others that were bidden?</l>
               <l>Said fool, the cauſe I feaſts frequent I trow,</l>
               <l>Is not for meat, but manners there to ſhow.</l>
               <l>Now for new words, ſome men as error-breeders,</l>
               <l>Condemn, and tearm them fruits of fancie-feeders:</l>

               <l>Some words tearm'd new, oft gives a greater light</l>

               <l>Which ground in ſome, I truſt lay'd long agone;</l>
               <l>The next work now is, how to build thereon:</l>
               <l>Alwayes foreſeen, that from the living ſpring:</l>
               <l>Our works their livelineſs and vigour bring:</l>

               <l>But to end this, like brother with his brother,</l>
               <l>The Law and Goſpel, muſt be each with other:</l>
               <l>With fire and hammer, that to break the rocks:</l>

               <l>Which I according to the Scripture hold,</l>
               <l>To be the Law of love (as I have told.</l>
               <l>When as the love of Chriſt doth men conſtrain,</l>

               <l>Till giving th'onſet, and things further trying:</l>
               <l>I finde good cauſe to charge my heart with lying.</l>

               <l>Fear, leſt through Satans wiles, ſome harm be acted.</l>
               <l>I mean, leſt men, through wonted love abate,</l>
               <l>And Satan, their affections alienate.</l>
               <l>I ſpeak not this for nothing, for I find</l>

               <l>There's yet a courſe my ſelf and others do,</l>

               <l>There was upon a time a queſtion ſtirred,</l>
               <l>What was the teſtimony of the ſpirit:</l>
               <l>One anſwered, he held it to be this:</l>
               <l>When by Gods ſpirit, one aſſured is.</l>
               <l>By reaſon out of Scripture of his caſe,</l>
               <l>Another ſaid, That ſame an error was.</l>
               <l>For that the Spirit withneſſeth (quoth he)</l>
               <l>To ſpeak in proper tearms (immediately)</l>
               <l>Yet he in fine concluded ſo to do,</l>
               <l>Was one kind of his teſtimonie too:</l>
               <l>The anſwerer by this conceav'd, he ſmelt</l>
               <l>Th'oppoſers moving, and his pulſes felt;</l>
               <l>That either he miſtook himſelf oppoſ'd:</l>
               <l>When (he conceits) th'anſwer for peace was chooſ'd.</l>
               <l>When as [immediat] is ſo harsh to many,</l>
               <l>As tis not almoſt yeilded to by any:</l>
               <l>Or elſe, perhaps ſome over by conceite,</l>
               <l>Eſpyed in anſwerer, he down would beat;</l>
               <l>This was in't ſelf good, and perhaps did need:</l>
               <l>And well may ſuch endeavours ever ſpeed.</l>
               <l>Thus for becauſe the godlineſſe of ſuch,</l>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97089:174"/>
               <l>And gravity thereto induce me much.</l>

               <l>Whiles Conſcience knows, my ſins recorded be</l>
